      "\n",
      "The Indian Constitution is unique in its content and spirit.The Constitution of India is the supreme law of India. The document lays down the framework demarcating fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written constitution of any country on earth. B. R. Ambedkar, chairman of the drafting committee, is widely considered to be its chief architect. The Constitution was adopted by the India Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949, and came into effect on 26 January 1950. The date of 26 January was chosen to commemorate the Purna Swaraj declaration of independence of 1930. With its adoption, the Union of India officially became the modern and contemporary Republic of India and it replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country's fundamental governing document. To ensure constitutional autochthony, the framers of constitution inserted Article 395 in the constitution and by this Article the Indian Independence Act, 1947 was repealed. The Constitution declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens of justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavors to promote fraternity among them. The words \"socialist\" and \"secular\" were added to the definition in 1976 by constitutional amendment (mini constitution). India celebrates the adoption of the constitution on 26 January each year as Republic Day.\n",
      "1. Longest and comprehensive constitution \n",
      "Our constitution is the longest and most comprehensive one when it is compared with other constitutions of the world countries. According to Ivor Jennings, “the constitution of India is the longest and most detailed in the world”. The Original constitution contained as many as 395 Articles and 8 schedules. Even after the repeal of several provisions it still (as in 1996) contains 444 Articles and 12 schedules. In respect of its size, it is five times larger than the American constitution. The size of our constitution has been enlarged on account of numerous provisions inserted with a view to covering all the problems peculiar to India. \n",
      "2. Preamble\n",
      "Indian constitution starts with a comprehensive preamble which reflects the socio-economic and political policies of the country. It contains sovereignty, socialism, secularism, democracy and the republican principles. It consists of social, economic and political justice. It has the liberty of thought, expression, belief faith and worship. It deals with the equality of status and of opportunity among all. It has the fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation. Above all, the preamble is considered as a part of the constitution.\n",
      "3. Fundamental Rights\n",
      "The part III of our constitution embodies a set of Fundamental Rights which are guaranteed to all citizens. They are termed as the Magna Carta of the essential freedoms of the Indian people. These rights have a justifiable character inspite of the fact that the state may impose the reasonable restrictions on their use and enjoyment. According to Jawaharlal Nehru, the Fundamental Rights are as the conscience of the constitution. The original constitution guaranteed seven fundamental rights like right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, right to property and the right to constitutional remedies. The right to property has been eliminated from the fundamental rights by the 44th Amendment Act. Thereby, there are six fundamental rights at present. According to B.R. Ambedkar, the fundamental rights especially the right to constitutional remedy (Article ; 32) is the heart of the constitution. Because, it safeguards the rights, freedom and privileges of every citizen by he application of Habeas corpus, Mandamus, certiorari, prohibition and quo-warranto.\n",
      "4. Directive Principles of State Policy\n",
      "The Unique feature of the constitution is the Directive principles of state policy which is part IV of our constitution. According to B.R. Ambedkar, the directive principles are the novel feature of the constitution. The directive principles are not justiciable in character whereas the fundamental rights are justiciable in the court of law. Gandhian and the socialist principles are included in the parts. The directive principles lay down that the state shall strive to ensure for its people adequate means of livelihood, fair distribution of wealth, equal pay for equal work, protection of child labour, employment and free and compulsory education for children upto the age of fourteen. The policies also lay down that the state shall make effective provisions for public assistance in the event of unemployment, oldage, sickness, disability and other cases of undeserved wants, a living wage, conditions of service assuring a decent standard of life, full employment of leisure, and raising the level of nutrition and health.\n",
      "5. Fundamental Duties\n",
      "The provision for fundamental duties is another feature of our constitution. Originally, we had no fundamental duties in our constitution. The 42nd Amendment brought in 1976 has lad to the creation of Article 51-A in which en fundamental duties of the citizen have been listed. Respects for constitution, the country, the National flag, the National Anthem and the leadership; protection of public property; safeguarding the historical and monumental places; enriching the culture and civilization; co-operation with the state; patriotism to have unity and integrity of the Nation; etc. are some of the fundamental duties stated in our constitution.\n",
      "6. Borrowed Constitution\n",
      "Generally, our constitution is said to be ‘borrowed’ constitution because most of its provisions have been substantially taken from other constitutions. For examples, the parliamentary or cabinet or prime ministerial form of government has been derived from the British constitution where as the fundamental rights have been taken from the American constitution. As such, the provisions of citizenship and the Directive principles of state policy have been borrowed from the Irish constitution. Even though it is a borrowed constitution, the credit of its frames lies in gathering the best features of our constitution.\n",
      "7. Partly rigid & Partly Flexible Constitution\n",
      "Our constitution is partly rigid and partly flexible. Actually, the rigidity or flexibility of a constitution depends on the Amendment procedure. Article – 368 of our constitution deals with the Amendment procedure. There are three methods to amend the constitution: simple majority of the parliament, 2/3 majority of the parliament, and the 2/3 majority of the parliament plus ½ majority of the State Legislatures. So far, we have amended our constitution nearly hundred times. So that, it is said that our constitution lacks its originality. In our conclusive point, we can say, that our constitution is more flexible than rigid.\n",
      "8. Parliamentary Form of Government\n",
      "Parliamentary form of government is another feature of our constitution. As practiced in Britain, Japan and Malaysia, we follow the parliamentary form of government in the centre and in the states in our country. But, democracy is a primary policy and way in the parliamentary form. Here, it is desirable for us to bring and understand the features of parliamentary form of government in general in India. Firstly, there are two heads known as nominal head and the real head of the state. The President is nominal head of the state where as the Prime Minister is the real head of the executive. It exists in the state level also. Secondly, leadership of the Prime Minister is an acknowledged fact in the parliamentary democracy. Prime Minister is the architect of the council of ministers. He can shuffle his pack as he pleases. However, it is expected that he will consult his senior colleagues before constituting the cabinet. Thirdly, the council of ministers are invariably drawn from the parliament especially from the lower house known as Lok Sabyha. If a particular minister is not a member of parliament, he is required to seek its membership within six months. Fourthly, the council of ministers is collectively responsible to the parliament. “All are one and one for all” principle applies in the parliamentary democracy. Also, each minister is individually responsible to the parliament for the department that he holds. Fifthly, there should be sound opposition which is a very soul of parliamentary democracy. Finally, the political homogeneity, an important characteristic of parliamentary form, has been accorded due recognition in the Indian politics. It means that all ministers are from a particular party which is a majority party in the election.\n",
      "9. Combination of Federal and Unitary Features \n",
      "The combination of federal and the unitary form of government is observed from the constitution. The federal form or the unitary form mainly depends upon the division of powers between the centre and the units. In India, the division of powers between the centre and the states is listed in the VIIth schedule. Since there is division of powers, we say that ours is formally a federal form of government. But, what do we find in the constitution? There are three lists – union list,  state list and he concurrent list. The Union list has 97 items of powers whereas the state list contains 66 items of powers and the concurrent list has 47 items. Since there is unequal division of powers between the union and the states, we conclude that ours is practically a Unitary Form of Government. Above all, we observe that our form of Government is structurally federal and functionally unitary.\n",
      "10. Independence of Judiciary \n",
      "Independence of judiciary and the judicial review are also important feature of our constitution. Regarding the independence of judiciary, the judiciary under the constitution is independent from the executive and the legislature. For the appointment of judges, definite and rigid qualifications have been laid down in the constitution. The President of India is bound to consult the Chief Justice of India in the appointment of every judge of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Their salary can not be reduced during their tenure expect in the case of Financial Emergency declared by the President under Articles 360. Concerning the judicial reviews, it has been specifically, provided for in the constitution. Under this system, the Supreme court can strike down the laws passed by the parliament if they are challenged and found against the provisions of the constitution. The orders of the executive are also subject to judicial review. Similarly, the laws passed by the state legislature and the executive orders at the state level are also subject to the judicial review. As we have observed, the Supreme Court and the High Courts, have independence and the judicial review. Above all, the judiciary in India is considered to be a watch dog of the constitution and the guardian of democracy. The judiciary protects not only the constitution, but also the rights, liberty and privileges of every citizens of India. \n",
      "11. Bicameral Legislature \n",
      "The constitution of India has provided for the Bicameral Legislature in the centre. Our Parliament has two Houses – the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The Lok Sabha is the Lower House or the First Chamber and it represents the whole nation. The Rajya Sabha is the Upper House or Second chamber and it represents the states. The maximum strength of the Lok Sabha has been fixed at 545 by the 31st Amendment. The maximum strength of the Rajya Sabha has been fixed at 250. Out of this total number, 12 members are nominated by the President. The remaining 238 members represent the states and the union territories. In practice, the Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha. But, the bicameral and the unicameral legislatures are existing in the states in India. \n",
      "12. Supremacy of Constitution\n",
      "As a matter of fact, the constitution of India is considered to be the primary law of the land. There are Civil Law, Criminal Law, Company Law, Family Law, Labour Law the law of Contract, the law of torts, the law of evidence etc in our country. But, of all the laws, the constitutional law is the primary and supreme one. With the introduction of the 42nd Amendment, a new part, XIV-A, has been inserted in the constitution. It deals with the creation of Tribunals to settle the administrative problems (Article 323-A).\n",

      "LESSON – 2\n",
      "THE PREAMBLE\n",
      "\n",
      "The Preamble serves as an introduction to the Constitution. It was amended by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act in 1976, which determined to constitute India into a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, and Democratic republic. It secures justice, liberty, equality to all the citizens of India and promotes fraternity among the people. \n",
      "The Preamble states:\n",
      "WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:\n",
      "JUSTICE, social, economic and political;\n",
      "LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\n",
      "EQUALITY of status and of opportunity;\n",
      "and to promote among them all\n",
      "FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;\n",
      "IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Four Components of the Preamble are:\n",
      "1. The Preamble indicates that the source of authority of the Constitution lies with the people of India.\n",
      "2. It declares India to be a socialist, secular, secular, democratic and a republic nation.\n",
      "3. It states its objectives to secure justice, liberty, equality to all citizens and promote fraternity to maintain unity and integrity of the nation.\n",
      "4. It mentions the date (November 26, 1949) on which the constitution was adopted.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE CONSTITUTION\n",
      "Every Constitution has a philosophy of its own.\n",
      "Independent And Sovereign \n",
      "As has been already explained, the Constitution of India, unlike the proceeding Government of India Acts, is not a gift of the British Parliament. It is ordained by the people of India through their representatives assembled in a sovereign Constituent Assembly which was competent to determine the political future of the country in any manner it liked. The words—'We, the people of India... adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution', thus, declare the ultimate sovereignty of the people of India and that the Constitution rests on their authority.\n",
      "Sovereignty means the independent authority of a State. It means that it has the power to legislate on any subject; and that it is not subject to the control of any other State or external power.\n",
      "Republic\n",
      "The Preamble declares, therefore, in unequivocal terms that the source of all authority under the Constitution is the people of India and that there is no subordination to any external Authority. While Pakistan remained a British Dominion until 1956, India ceased to be a Dominion and declared herself a 'Republic' since the making of the .Constitution in 1949, It means a government by the people and for the people. \n",
      "We have an elected President at the head of our State, and all office including that of the President will be open to all citizens.\n",
      "Democracy \n",
      "The picture of a 'democratic republic'  which the Preamble envisages is democratic not only from the political but also from the social standpoint ; in other words, it envisages not only a democratic form of government but also a democratic society, infused with the spirit of 'justice, liberty, equality and fraternity'. \n",
      "Economic Justice \n",
      "The banishment of poverty, not by expropriation of those who have, jut by the multiplication of the national wealth and resources and an equitable distribution thereof amongst all who contribute towards its production, is the aim of the State envisaged by the Directive Principles. Economic democracy will be installed in our sub-1 continent to the extent mat this goal is reached. In short, economic justice aims at establishing economic democracy and a 'Welfare State'.\n",
      "Liberty \n",
      "Democracy, in any sense, cannot be established unless certain minimal rights, which are essential for a free and civilised existence, are assured to every member of the community. Preamble mentions these essential individual rights as 'freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship' and these are guaranteed against all the of the State by Part III of the Constitution [vide Arts. 19, 25-28], of course, to the implementation of the Directive Principles, for the good [Art. 31C] and the 'fundamental duties', introduced [Art. 51 A],  by the 42nd Amendment. 1976.\n",
      "Equality\n",
      "Guaranteeing of certain rights to each individual would be meaningless unless all inequality is banished from the social structure and each individual is of equality of status and opportunity for the development of the best in him and the means for the enforcement of the rights guaranteed to him. This is secured in the body of the Constitution, by making illegal all discriminations by the State between citizen and citizen, simply on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex or place [Art. 15]; by throwing open 'public places' to all citizens [Art. 15(2)]; by abolishing untouchability [Art. 17]; by abolishing titles of honour [Art 18] ; by offering equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment under the state [Art. 16]; by guaranteeing equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, as justiciable rights [Art. 14].\n",
      "In, addition to the above provisions to ensure civic equality the Constitution to achieve political equality by providing for universal adult franchise 326] and by reiterating that no person shall be either excluded from the I electoral roll or allowed to be included in any general or special electoral, only on the ground of his religion, race, caste or sex [Art. 325]. \n",
      "Apart from these general provisions, there are special provisions in the Directive Principles [Part IV] which enjoin the State to place the two sexes on an equal footing in the economic sphere, by securing to men and women equal: to work and equal pay for equal work [Art. 39, Cls. (a),(b).\n",
      "Fraternity \n",
      "The 'Fraternity' cherished by the framers of the Constitution will be achieved\" not only by abolishing untouchability amongst the different sects of the same community, but by abolishing all communal or sectional or even local or: provincial anti-social feelings which stand in the way of the unity of India.\n",
      "Democracy would indeed be hollow if it fails to generate this spirit of brotherhood amongst all sections of the people, — a feeling that they are all children of the same soil, the same Motherland. It becomes all the more essential in a country like India, composed of so many races, religions, languages and cultures. \n",
      "Dignity of the Individual \n",
      "A fraternity cannot, however, be installed unless the dignity of each of its members is maintained. The Preamble, therefore, says that the State, in India, will assure the dignity of the Individual. The Constitution seeks to achieve this object by guaranteeing equal fundamental rights to each individual, so that he can enforce his minimal rights, if invaded by anybody, in a court of law. 'Seeing that these justiciable rights may not be enough to maintain the dignity of an individual if he is not free from wants and misery, a number of Directives have beenincluded in Part IV of the Constitution, exhorting the State so to shape its social and economic policies that, inter alia, \"all citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood\" [Art. 39(a)], \"just and humane conditions of work\" [Art. 42], and \"a decent standard of life and foil enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities\" [Art. 43]. Our Supreme Court has come to hold that the right to dignity is a fundamental right. \n",
      "Popular Sovereignty  \n",
      "The Constitution proclaims the sovereignty of the people in its opening words. The preamble begins with the words, “We the people of India having solemnly resolved to constitute Indian into a sovereign ... republic”. The idea is reaffirmed in several places in the Constitution, particularly in the chapter dealing with elections. Article 326 declares that “the elections to the House of People and to the Legislative Assembly of ever State shall be on the basis of adult suffrage”. As a result, the government at the Centre and in the States derive their authority from the people who wield the executive power of the government are responsible to the legislature and through them to the people. Thus, in the affairs of the State, it is the will of the people that prevails ultimately and not the will of a few selfish individuals. This is the principle of popular sovereignty. \n",
      "In spite of the ignorance and illiteracy of large sections of the Indian people, the Constituent Assembly adopted the principle of adult franchise with faith in the common man and the ultimate success of democratic rule. The assembly was the opinion that democratic government on the basis of adult suffrage would along “bring enlightenment and promote well-being, the standard of life, the comfort and decent living of the common man”.   \n",
      "The principle of popular sovereignty has not been a mere ideal embodied in the Constitution but has been a living reality during the last five decades and more during which the Constitution has been in operation. In fact, this precious right in their hands, which ensures the democratic ideal of “one man, one vote, one value”, irrespective of his wealth, education, social status and “importance”, has, in fact, enhanced their self-respect as citizens of a democratic India. \n",
      "Free elections are, perhaps, the greatest forum of mass education. The dangers inherent in adult suffrage among an illiterate people can be mitigated only by the blessings of universal education. In a country like India, the large majority of whose population is illiterate, the attainment of universal education is a goal still a long way off. But this need not necessarily mean that until a certain minimum standard of universal education is realised, the Indian masses are incapable of properly exercising their right of franchise. Illiteracy is not quite the same thing as ignorance. A free election which ensure the free exchange of ideas and free canvassing by contending parties who stand for differing programmes of social organisation for the realisation of the common welfare, offers the best medium for the political education of the illiterate masses. It is this that the Constitution guarantees. The Constitution-makers were not satisfied by merely providing for adult suffrage. They wanted to ensure fee elections by creating an independent constitutional authority to be in charge of everything connected with elections. Free election is a reality in India. It ensures for the electors both the freedom of choice and secrecy of the ballot. The eleven general election shave demonstrated that the ordinary man, in spite of his so-called ignorance, has been able to exercise his robust commonsense in electing candidates of his choice. Neither money nor social status nor official position has been powerful enough to make him a convenient toll in the hands of self-seeking politicians. This perhaps is the surest and the most welcome guarantee that popular sovereignty will remain a living reality in India despite the fact that large sections of its people are steeped in ignorance, poverty and social backwardness.      \n",
      "Socialism \n",
      "Even before the adoption of the new Constitution, the Government of independent Indian had made clear its policy to enter the economic field in a very active manner. The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 gives ample evidence of this. It envisaged a greater role for the State in the economic development of the country. Certain industries such as atomic energy, manufacturing of arms and ammunition and Railways were declared to be the sole monopoly of the State. The right of the State to nationlise any major industry and bringing it within the public sector was also clearly stated nevertheless the Constitution did not explicitly state anywhere that is stood for the establishment of a socialist State. \n",
      "The Directive Principles of State Policy, however, unmistakable set out the socialist objective of the Constitution, although one might point out that they do not go far enough to establish a full-fledged socialist order. But then it is also clear that our constitution with its emphasis on a set of guaranteed fundamental rights did not envisage a collectivist socialist State like those existed in Eastern Europe during 1945 and 1990. ON the contrary, it aims at establishing a democratic socialist Sate which, while moving progressively towards the socialist ideal, wants at the same time to protect and preserve basic human rights.\n",
      "Nevertheless successive amendments to the Constitution clearly show that the direction is more towards the realisation of socialist than the democratic ideal. The Constitution was amended several times with a view to realising this objective. Among those amendments, special mention may be made of the First, Fourth, Seventeenth, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-ninth, Thirty-fourth and Forty-second Amendments. Almost everyone of these give precedence to the Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights in the implementation of certain legislative enactments. The Forty-second Amendment (1976) went a step furter and amended the Preamble of the Constitution to include specifically the term “socialist” which was absent in the original form in which it was enacted.\n",
      "Secularism \n",
      "The Constitution aims to establish a secular State. And a secular State means in essence that the State will not make any discrimination whatsoever on the ground of religion or community against any person professing any particular form of religious faith. No particular religion in the State will be identified as State religion nor will it receive any State religion; nor will the State accord any citizen or discriminate against him simply on the ground that he professes a particular form of religion. The fact that a person professes a particular religion will not be taken into consideration in his relationship with the State or its agencies. \n",
      "This does mot mean that the State in India is anti-religious. Secularism in its original, historical sense was an anti-God and anti-religious concept. But in the Indian context that concept has no relevance. In the words of Ambedkar, Secular State does not mean that we shall not take into consideration the religious sentiments of people. “All that a secular State means is that this Parliament shall not be competent to impose any particular religion upon the rest of the people”. \n",
      "Thus the distinguishing feature of a secular democracy as contemplated by the Constitution of India are: (i) that the State will not identify itself with or be controlled by any religion; (ii) that while the State guarantees to everyone the right to profess whatever religion one chooses to follow (which includes also the right to be an agnostic or an atheist), it will not accord any preferential treatment to any of them: (iii) that  no discrimination will be shown by the State against any person on account of his religion or faith; and (iv) that the right of every citizen, subject to any general conditions, to enter any office under the State will be equal to that of the fellow citizens. Political equality which entitles any Indian citizen to seek the highest office under the State is the heart and soul of secularism as envisaged by the Constitution.\n",
      "LESSON – 3 \n",
      "FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS\n",
      "Objectives\n",
      "1. To know about the Fundamental Rights\n",
      "2. To know about the Fundamental duties.\n",
      "Structure\n",
      "Introduction – Fundamental rights – Right to equality—Right to freedom – Right against exploitation – right to religion – Cultural and Educational Rights – Right to constitutional Remedies – Fundamental Duties – Conclusion.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Part III of the Constitution incorporating ‘fundamental rights’ constitutes the Magna Carta of the essential rights of the Indian people. It contains a very comprehensive list of the rights that have a justiciable character in spite of the fact that the State may impose ‘reasonable restrictions’ on certain grounds on their use and enjoyment and that their enforcement can be suspended by the President during the days of national emergency excluding those relating to life and personal liberty enshrined in Articles 20 and 21. The 24 Constitution Amendment Act of 1971 has laid down that the Parliament may make any change in Part III of the Constitution in the public interest amounting to the extension or abridgement of the scope of the fundamental rights. \n",
      "Part III mentions six categories of fundamental rights along with qualifying provision hedged around them with the more formidable provisions enabling the Parliament to make necessary amendments in the Constitution in the name of placing ‘reasonable restrictions’ on the use and enjoyment of these rights. These are:\n",
      "Right to Equality \n",
      "Right to Freedom \n",
      "Right against Exploitation \n",
      "Right to Religion \n",
      "Cultural and Educational Rights \n",
      "Right to Constitutional Remedies  \n",
      "Right to Equality \n",
      "First of all, we have right to equality. Art 14 says that the State shall not deny to any person equality before law or equal protection of  laws within its territory. Art 15 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth ; nor can any person on any of these grounds be held able or unable for access to shops, hotels, public restaurants and places of public entertainment, use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly by the State funds or dedicated to the use of general public Art. 16 says about the equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. It is further provided that in respect of public employment, the State can make no discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence. Art. 17 declares the abolition of untouchability and forbids its practice in any form. Finally, Art. 18 says that the State shall confer no title on any person save that of a military or academic distinction.\n",
      "The Constitution also specifies that these rights are subject to certain restraints. Thus, Article 15(3) and (4) lays down that though there can be no discrimination against persons on several grounds, it shall be open for the State to make any provision for the welfare of the women and children, or for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of the society. Similarly, in the case of Art. 16 providing for non-discrimination in matters of public employment, it is further given that the State can make special reservations and safeguards for the representation of the weaker sections of the society in public institutions, or that it shall be open for the State to lay down qualifications of residence (domicile) in respect of public employments in any part of the country. Likewise, Art 18 dealing with the abolition of titles, save those of military and academic distinctions, further says that no citizen shall receive a title from a foreign State without the permission of the President of India.\n",
      "Right to Freedom\n",
      "Art. 19 guarantees six kinds of essential freedom relating to speech and expression, peaceful assembly without arms, forming associations or unions, free movement throughout the territory of India, residence and settlement in any part of territory of India, and practice of any profession, trade or business. Art. 20 provides for protection in respect of conviction for certain offences. It prohibits the promulgation of ex-post facto laws-laws with retrospective effect going to the disadvantage of the accused. It says that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for the violation of law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission  of the offence; that no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence ; that no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once; and that no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. Art. 21 says that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. Finally, Art. 22 guarantees protection against arbitrary arrest and detention. The man in custody will be informed, as soon as possible, of the grounds of such arrest. Moreover, an arrested person shall not be denied the right to engage or consult a legal practitioner of his choice for the sake of making his defence. It is also provided that a person who is arrested and placed under police custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of 24 hours of such arrest (excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of his arrest to the court of the magistrate) and that no such person shall be kept in custody beyond the said period without the order of the magistrate. \n",
      "All these rights are subject to reasonable restrictions. Art. 19 ensuring six kinds of essential freedoms has qualifying provisions that enable the State to lay down reasonable restrictions in the interest of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency, morality, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to an offence etc. the State may also lay down special rules for technical and professional services, or for carrying on any trade or profession in general public interest; similar arrangements can be made for the protection of the interest of the weaker sections of the community. Then, Art. 22 provides for the preventive detention that makes a distinction between a citizen and an alien, particularly one belonging to an enemy country, and it also provides for a special procedure in case of persons rounded up under the law of preventive detention as made by the government of the Centre or of any State.\n",
      "Rights Against Exploitation\n",
      "The third category includes rights against exploitation. Art. 23 prohibits traffic in human beings and taking of forced labour like begar. A qualifying clause says that nothing shall prevent the State from imposing compulsory service for a public purpose, and in imposing such a service, the State shall not make any discrimination on various grounds like those of religion, race, class and the like. This provision specifically prohibits slavery or ‘bonded labour’ and traffic of human beings for immoral purposes. Art. 24 prohibits employment of children below 14 years of age in hazardous jobs.\n",
      "Right to Religion\n",
      "Then comes right to religion that constitutes the sheet-anchor of our secular state. Art 25 ensures freedom of conscience and free profession of any practice and propagation of any faith or religion. Art. 26 guarantees freedom to every religious denomination or to any section there of to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes to manage its own affairs in matters of religion, to own and acquire movable and immovable property and to administer such property in accordance with law. Art. 27 says that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any religion or religious denomination. Finally, Art. 28 prohibits compulsory attendance at religious instructions imparted in an institution wholly or partly maintained by the State.\n",
      "Like other fundamental rights, this right is also subject to certain qualifying restrictions as norms of public order, morality and health. It is also provided that the State shall have the right to regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political or other activity that may be associated with a religious practice, or to provide for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of public character to all classes and sections of the Hindus. While defining the word ‘Hindu’, it is said that it shall be construed to cover the Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, and the wearing and carrying of kirpans shall be deemed to be included in the profession of Sikh religion. The provision of attendance at religions instructions in educational institutions, either wholly or partly maintained by the State, shall not apply to an institution which is administered by the State but has been established under some endowment or trust enjoining that religious instruction of that variety be imparted in the institution.\n",
      "Cultural and Educational Rights \n",
      "The fifth category relates to cultural and educational rights. Art. 29 lays down that any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India having its distinct language, script or culture shall have the right to conserve the same. No citizen shall be denied admission to any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of the State funds on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. Art. 30 says that all minorities, whether base don religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. The State shall not, while granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority whether based on religion or language. In making any law for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority, the state shall ensure that the amount fixe by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause.\n",
      "Right to Constitutional Remedies \n",
      "Last, there is right to constitutional remedies. Since Part III of the Constitution is justiciable, an aggrieved person may move the High Courts (under Art.226) or the Supreme Court (under Art.32) for the protection of his fundamental rights. Art. 13(2) clearly lays down that no law (including executive action) of the Centre, or of the States, or of any subordinate government can prevail that is inconsistent with Part III of the Constitution. Thus, the Courts may look into the matter and then hold that law invalid, either fully or in part, so as to enforce the provisions of this part of the Constitution. For this sake, they may issue prerogative writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari. In the words of a former Chief Justice of India, this provision is ‘a very distinguishing feature of the Indian Constitution’ and ‘a cornerstone of the democratic edifice raised by the Constitution.’\n",
      "The Constitution empowers the Supreme Court and the High Courts to issue five kinds of writs for the protection and enforcement of fundamental rights. These are :\n",
      "Writ of Habeas Corpus: The Court may ask the detaining authority to produce the person before it and justify the cause of his detention there. If the Court feels that the reason of detention is not sufficient, it may ask the detaining authority to release the person.\n",
      "Writ of Mandamus: The Court may order any inferior court or authority to perform some public or quasi-public legal duty which it has refused to perform and the performance of which cannot be enforced by any other adequate legal remedy.\n",
      "Writ of Prohibition: The Court may order any inferior court or authority not to do what is not within its jurisdiction. It is different from mandamus in the sense that while the latter commands activity, it commands inactivity. Moreover, while the writ of mandamus can be issued to command any judicial or quasi-judicial or non-judicial authority, the writ of prohibition is issued only against a judicial or quasi-judicial authority.\n",
      "Writ of Certiorari: While the writ of prohibition is available at an earlier stage, the writ of certiorari is available at a later stage only. The two resemble as well as differ. The object of both is to secure that the jurisdiction of an inferior court or tribunal is properly exercised and that it does not usurp the jurisdiction which it does not possess. Thus, the Court may ask any inferior court or tribunal not to proceed ahead with the case before it but to transfer it to some other court or tribunal.\n",
      "Writ of Quo Warranto: The Court may inquire into the legality of the claim which a person asserts to a public office and to oust him from its exercise if the claim be not well founded. Thus the Court may quash a wrong appointment. But here three conditions must be satisfied. First, the office must be public and it must be created by a statute or by the Constitution itself. Second, the office must be a substantive one and not merely the function or employment of a servant at the will and during the pleasure of another. Last, there must be a contravention of the Constitution or of a statute or of a statutory instrument in appointing such person to that office.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "As Basu says: the citizen, it is expected, should be his own monitor, while exercising and enforcing his fundamental rights remembering that he owes the duties to the State and that if he does not care for the duties, he should not deserve the rights.... Of course, the duty as such is not legally enforceable in the Court, but if the State makes a law to prohibit any act or conduct in violation of any of the duties, the Courts would uphold that as a reasonable restriction on the relevant fundamental right just as they did uphold any law implementing the Directive Principles.”\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The principles, in accordance with which any State develops on the pre-fixed plan, are called the directive principles of State policy.

      "Importance of the Directive Principles of State Policy: These principles are unique and are of much utility. In the words of Dr. Ambedkar, “They are noval feature in the Constitution framed for Parliamentary democracy.” The directive principles of the State Policy are that goal, the achievement of which is our moral duty. These principles will contribute in the establishment of welfare State and will bring about political stability and administrative uniformity. These will lead to the establishment of a political democracy and a society based on socialistic pattern will be created. Commenting on the importance of the Directive Principles of State Policy, PB. Gajendragadkar, former Chief Justice of India, has aptly observed, 'The ultimate object of the Directive Principles is to liberate the Indian masses in a positive sense; to free them from possivity engendered by centuries of coercion by society and by nature and by ignorance and from the object physical conditions that had prevented them from fulfilling their best selves.”\n",
      "Difference between Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights:\n",
      "The following are the difference between Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights:\n",
      "Fundamental Rights are Justifiable and Directive Principles are not: The Fundamental Rights are justifiable but the Directive Principles are not justifiable. The Fundamental Rights are enforceable in the Courts of law but the Directives are not enforceable The Fundamental Rights are enforceable by the Courts of law and the Courts are bound to declare as void any law that is inconsistent with any of the Fundamental Rights but the Directive Principles are not enforceable by Courts of law and the Courts cannot declare as void any law which is otherwise valid on the ground that it contravenes any of the Directive Principle of State Policy.\n",
      "The Fundamental impose limitations upon State action but the Directive Principles do not: The Fundamental Rights impose limitation upon State action; the Directive Principles are in the nature of instruments of instructions to the Government of the day to do certain things and to achieve certain ends by their action.\n",
      "Fundamental Rights can be declared null and void but the Directive Principles cannot be held so: A law which contravenes a \n",
      "fundamental right can be declared null and void by the appropriate authority, whereas a law contrary to the Directive Principles cannot be so held.\n",
      "Fundamental Rights are full-fledged rights while the Directive Principles are inchoate fundamental rights: The Fundamental Rights are full fledged rights whereas the Directive Principles can be described as inchoate right. The Directive Principles require legislation to become effective, whereas the Fundamental Rights need no such legislation.\n",
      "Fundamental Rights predominate over Directive Principles: Another difference between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles is that the former predominate over the latter. If there is a conflict between the Fundamental rights and the Directive Principles, the former will prevail over the latter.\n",
      "During the last 48 years of the operation of Indian Constitution, the Government has taken certain remarkable steps to implement the Directive Principles of State Policy. Here we are giving a brief account:\n",
      "Employment of children and women in hazardous jobs has been prevented.\n",
      "Numerous factory laws have been enacted and the wages and working hours had been regulated.\n",
      "In order to improve the condition of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, 20 per cent posts have been reserved for the Scheduled Castes and 2 per cent for the Scheduled Tribes, in educational institutions also, the seats in the aforesaid percentage have been reserved for them. Seats have also been reserved for them in the Parliament and the State Legislatures.\n",
      "Bonded labour has been abolished by a law passed in 1976.\n",
      "By another law passed in 1976, it has been provided that both men and women will be paid equal wages for the equal work\n",
      "Efforts have been made to introduce prohibition in the country.\n",
      "With a view to improve the economic condition of the villagers, the State has taken various steps for improvement of agriculture and animal husbandry on scientific lines. Cottage and small scale industries are being encouraged in the villages and for this purpose, loan facilities are being extended and technical know-how provided.\n",
      "Certain industries have been nationalised with a view to preventing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few persons. Different types of taxes such as Wealth Tax, Property Tax, Income Tax etc. have been imposed so as to deprive the richer section of the society of their surplus wealth.\n",
      "Provision hag been made for imparting free and compulsory education to children upto the age of 14 years.\n",
      "The Panchayati Raj institutions have been set up throughout the country.\n",
      "Judiciary has been separated from the Executive in most of the States,\n",
      "The Government of India has established an Archaeological Department for protecting the historical national monuments, Destruction and spoliation of historical monuments is punishable by an Act passed in the year 1951. The export of antiquities has been prohibited.\n",
      "The Government is following the policy of peace, friendship, non-alignment and co-operation in the international field and has always upheld the principles of U.N.O.\n",
      "Technical Words\n",
      "Economic Justice – It provides a significant pillar to liberty. If people live under a constant fear of starvation and unemployment, liberty is reduced to a shadow without substance.\n",

      "THE UNION EXECUTIVE\n",
      "Objective\n",
      "1. To know about the powers and functions of the President of India.\n",
      "2. To acquaint with the functions of the Vice-President.\n",
      "Structure\n",
      "Introduction – Qualifications -  Election – Powers of President Election and Qualification of Vice-President – Functions of Vice-President.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Article 52 of the Constitution says that there shall be a President of India. He is the head of the Government. The President of Indian Republic occupies the highest position in the country. The framers of Indian Constitution have adopted parliamentary type of administration but along with it they have conferred upon the President the most glorious and the highest authority in the country.\n",
      "Qualifications\n",
      "Qualifications for the elections as President: In accordance with Article 5 8, a candidate for the post of President of Indian Republic must have following qualifications- (1) He must be a citizen of India; (2) His age must not be less than 35 years; (3) He must not hold any office of profit in Central or Provincial Governments The offices of President or Vice-President, Governor of any State, and the Ministers of the Union or any State are not considered the offices of profit for this purpose.\n",
      "Elections\n",
      "The election of the President is made through indirect method. He is elected by a electoral college which consists of two types of members- (i) elected members of both the Houses of Parliament, and (ii) elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States. The nominated members of the Parliament and the State Legislatures are not emitted to vote. Similarly the members of the Legislative Councils of the states are not entitled to cast their votes in the election of the President of the Indian Union. The representative capacity of the members of Parliament and State Legislature is decided by the following method.\n",
      "(a) Representative value of each elected member of the State Legislative Assemblies: The total population of the States is divided by total elected members of the Legislative Assembly and then it is divided by 1,000. The result of the said equation indicates the number of votes which a member of the Legislative Assembly is entitled to cast,\n",
      "(b) Representative value of each elected member of the Parliament: In order to find out the value of the vote of an elected member of Parliament, the total number of votes given by the elected members of all the Legislative Assembly of the State is divided by the total elected members of the both the Houses of the Parliament.\n",
      "Method of Voting and Counting\n",
      "The election of the President is made through proportional representation by single transferable vote. By single transferable vote, we mean that each member entitled to vote in the election of the president, will have to give all his votes to only one candidate. However, he can write his preferences before the names of the candidates written on ballot paper. A candidate who secures more than 50% votes in the first count is declared elected. In case none of the candidates secures more than 50% votes of first preference, the name of the last candidate is struck off and all his votes of second preference are divided among other candidates. The process continues till a candidate secures more than 50 per cent of all the votes. As soon as a candidate secures more than 50 per cent of votes, the counting is stopped and the result is declared.\n",
      "Oath\n",
      "A candidate elected as President has to take an oath before the Chief Justice of India that he will defend the Constitution and law of the land with all his ability and will devote himself in the service and welfare of Indian people.\n",
      "Tenure\n",
      "The President is elected for a term of 5 years. However, he continues to hold office even after the term of 5 years till his successor is elected. After the expiry of the term, he can be re-elected for another term. A vacancy occurring as a result of death, resignation or removal is filled up by election for the full term of five years and not for the residue of the predecessor’s term.\n",
      "Removal by Impeachment\n",
      "The President maybe removed from office by impeachment for the violation of the Constitution or for taking pan or interest in anti-national activities. Article 61 of the Constitution lays down the procedure for impeachment of the President. The impeachment charge can be initiated in either House of the Parliament, provided that at least 14 days written notice, signed by not less than 1/4 of its total members is given. If the impeachment charge is passed by 2/3 majority of the total membership of the House, it is then sent to the other House for investigation and decision. In case the other House also sustains the charge and passes it by a 2/3 majority, the President ceases to hold office with immediate effect. The President impeached ishowever, entitled to be heard and defended during the investigation of the charge against him.\n",
      "powers of the president\n",
      "The Constitution of India has conferred vast powers upon the President of Indian Republic. Article 53 of the Constitution says, 'The executive power of the union shall be vested in the President and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with this Constitution.” Almost all the powers of the Indian Union vest in President. His powers can be divided into following main two categories:\n",
      "(i) Powers of the President in normal times, (ii) Emergency powers of the President.\n",
      "Powers of the President in normal times: The powers of the President in normal times may be further divided into the following five categories:\n",
      "Administrative powers or executive powers: All the executive works of Union are done in the name of the President. Article 53 lays down that the executive powers of the Union will vest in the President, who will exercise these powers either himself or through other offices in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The executive or administrative powers of the President can be divided into several categories, which are briefly discussed below: \n",
      "Powers to appoint officials: The President appoints the leader of the majority party of the Parliament as Prime Minister and on his advice appoints other Ministers. The Governors of the States, Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, Attorney-General, Auditor-General, Chief Commissioners of the Union territories, Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission, India's Ambassadors to foreign countries etc. are also appointed by the President.\n",
      "Powers of directing the policy of the States: Through the Governors of the States and the Chief Commissioners of Union Territories, the President directs the policy of the State or Union Territories and exercises his control over them. In case of a breakdown or failure of the administrative machinery of any State he can take into his own hands all the administrative powers of that State.\n",
      "Powers regarding International Affairs: All the treaties and political, cultural and trade agreements with foreign countries are entered into in the name of the President. He accepts the credentials of the Ambassadors of foreign countries and appoints India's Ambassadors in foreign countries.\n",
      "Military powers: According to Article 53(2), the Supreme command of the Defence Forces of the Union shall be vested in President and the exercise thereof shall be regulated by law. However, he cannot declare war or employ forces without the sanction of Parliament or in anticipation of the sanction of Parliament.\n",
      "Legislative Powers: The President has several legislative powers as well, which are as follows-\n",
      "Power to summon sessions of Parliament and send message to it: Article 85 lays down that the President shall from time to time summon each House of Parliament to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session. The President may from time to time (a) prorogue the Houses or either House, (b) dissolve the House of the People. However, he is empowered to dissolve the Council of States or Rajya Sabha He address both the Houses of the Parliament severally or jointly or can send messages to them.\n",
      "Powers over legislative assemblies of the States: The consent of the President is necessary for making any law or imposing any restriction on the Legislative Assemblies of the States. There are many such types of bills, which do not become acts unless and until they receive the assent of the President.\n",
      "Powers to give assent on bills passed by Parliament: No bill passed by the Parliament can become law unless and until it receives the assent of the President. Every Bill passed by both Houses of Parliament is to be sent to the President for his assent. The President can with hold his assent from all Bills other than Money Bills. If the Bill is again passed by both the Houses of the Parliament with or without amendment, he must give his assent to it when it is sent to him for the second time. A bill for the recognition of a new State or alteration of State boundaries can only be introduced in either House of the Parliament after his recommendations. No money bill can be introduced in the Lok Sabha unless previous consent of the President has been obtained.\n",
      "Power to issue ordinances: The President can issue ordinances. The ordinances issued by the President will have the same effect as other acts and laws have. Such ordinances continue to be in force upto six weeks and after the date of beginning of the session of the Parliament and after that they automatically become ineffective. The President can withdraw any Ordinance at any time. He is also empowered to frame rules for the territories directly administered by the Centre.\n",
      "Financial Powers: The financial powers of the President are as follows: \n",
      "Power to get the budget presented: In the beginning of the financial year, the President gets the budget presented in the Parliament.\n",
      "Power regarding taxes and grants: The President also recommends the imposition of new taxes or abolition of existing taxes. He can also demand the grant for the performance of specific works.\n",
      "Power regarding System of distribution of Income: The President is also entitled to distribute properly the income of the whole country between the Central Government and the State Governments. It is the President who determines the sum of money to be given to different States.\n",
      "Power to appoint Finance Commission: The President is entitled to appoint the Finance Commission in order to solve problems concerning finances.\n",
      "Judicial Powers: The President appoints the judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence in three kinds of cases- (i) where the punishment or sentence is by a Court Martial; (ii) where it is for an offence against a law, relating to which the executive power of the Union extends; and (iii) where it is a death sentence.\n",
      "Privileges: Certain privileges have also been conferred upon the President by the Indian Constitution. He is not responsible or liable to any Court for his administrative and official works. Neither can any action be taken in any Court against him nor can warrant of arrest be issued against him by any Court. No civil action can also be taken against him unless two months' written notice is given for the same.\n",
      "(ii) Emergency Powers of the President: In emergency, the President can become all-in-all of the country. Indian Constitution envisages three kinds of emergencies:\n",
      "Emergency when the security of the country is threatened by war or external aggression or armed rebellion: Article 352(1) says, “If the President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India or any part of India is threatened, whether by war or external aggression or (Armed rebellion) or that there is imminent danger thereof, he may make a proclamation of Emergency (in respect of the whole of India or of such pan of the territory thereof as may be specified in the proclamation)”. Such a proclamation of Emergency may be revoked (or varied) by the President by a subsequent proclamation. The proclamation of Emergency must be laid before each House of Parliament and shall cease to operate at the expiry of two months unless it has beer approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. If the proclamation of Emergency is issued at the time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved, or its dissolution takes place during the period of two months without approving the resolution, and the Rajya Sabha approves it, the Proclamation shall cease to operate at the expiration of thirty days from the date on which the Lok Sabha first sits after its reconstitution, unless the Lok Sabha passed the resolution approving the Proclamation.\n",
      "The Proclamation of Emergency can be made even before the actual occurrence of events specified in Article 352 have taken place if the President is satisfied that there is imminent danger thereof [C1 (1)].\n",
      "The “satisfaction” that the security of India is threatened or there is an imminent danger of its being threatened by war or external aggression or internal disturbance, is the “subjective satisfaction” of the President and cannot be challenged in a Court of Law. The President is the sole judge to decide whether circumstances exist justifying the Proclamation of Emergency. Following will be the effects of such a proclamation in accordance with provisions of Articles 353, 354, 358 and 359.\n",
      "The Parliament can legislate on any matter whether it is in the Union List or not. Thus, it can take over and exercise any of the legislative powers of the State.\n",
      "The Union Government may give any direction to any State as to how the executive power of the latter should be exercised.\n",
      "The distribution of revenues between the Union and States may be modified by the order of President to such an extent as he deems necessary.\n",
      "The restriction imposed on the legislative power of the State in the interest of citizens. Fundamental Rights of freedom under Article 19 cease to operate.\n",
      "The enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights of the citizens by the courts may be suspended and all the proceedings pending in that connection also remain suspended temporarily.\n",
      "Emergency arising out of the Failure of Constitutional Machinery of the State: According to Article 356 of the Constitution, a proclamation of emergency arising out of the failure of the constitutional machinery of any State, may be issued by the President either on the report of the Governor of the State or on his own initiative, when the Government of that State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution or when it has failed to carry out a direction issued to it by the Union Government in respect of the administration of Union matters. The proclamation of the President in this connection may last only for two months. Its term can be extended for six months only when it is approved by both the House of the Parliament. After the expiry of six months, it will have to be reconsidered and then it can be extended for another six months. According to clause 50 of the 42nd Amendment Act, the duration of this emergency has been increased from six months to one year at a time. The maximum period for which such a proclamation may last, is three years. After the issue of the proclamation, the Parliament can empower the President, Governor or any other official to make laws for the State. The Union Executive may make law in respect of that state only when it is empowered by the Parliament. The President ought to exercise his powers with utmost care so as to avoid any possibility of internal conflicts.\n",
      "Financial Emergency: According to Article 360, a proclamation of financial emergency may be issued when the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen, whereby the financial stability or credit of India or any part of the territory is threatened The proclamation has to be placed before both the Houses of the Parliament and it can last for two months. But if in the meantime Parliament approves it, it will continue for further period. However, the President can revoke it at any time by a subsequent proclamation. The proclamation of financial emergency will have the following effects: \n",
      "The executive authority of the Union may give such directions to any State to observe such cannons of financial propriety as it thinks necessary and adequate for the purpose;\n",
      "Salaries and allowances of the State officers as also of the Union officers, including judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts may be ordered to be reduced;\n",
      "All money bills or other bills, to which the provisions of Article 207 apply, may be reserved for the consideration of the President after they are passed by the Legislature of the State.\n",
      "Can the President become a dictator: Here the question arises “Can the President of India be a dictator”. Before the Forty-second Amendment Act, there was a feeling in some of the critics that the President of India can be a dictator at any time. However, their notion was not correct, but there was fear. The position after the Forty-second Amendment Act is changed Before the Amendment Act, there was a feeling in some of the critics that whether the President is legally bound under Article 74(1) to accept the advice of the Council of Ministers under all circumstances the general feeling was that he is not. By the Forty-second Amendment Act, the fear has been removed. Before this Amendment Act, it was written in the Constitution, There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President in the exercise of his function.” Now this clause has been totally changed. It runs as follows, “There shall be Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President who shall, in exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice.”\n",
      "By the Constitution Amendment Act of 1944, following words were also included in the said clause. “(Provided that the President may require the Council of Minister to reconsider such advice, either generally or otherwise, and the President shall act in accordance with the advice tendered after such reconsideration)”. Now the President can once return a bill sent to him for approval for re-consideration of the Council of Ministers and Parliament. He shall be bound by such advice which was tendered to him after such re-consideration.\n",
      "The suspension of the fundamental rights of the citizens is also a point on which there can be an apprehension of the dictatorship. However, it is not correct. Now, the fundamental rights can be suspended only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Even before the Forty-second Amendment Act, it was wrong to apprehend that the President could misuse his powers. In any parliamentary system of administration, the President cannot disregard the advice of the Council of Ministers. In practice, the Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha and not to the President. So in case of conflict between the Council of Ministers and the President, the former will try to remove the latter of which it is fully capable of. Hence, the President of India shall never try to become a dictator, by disregarding the advice of the Council of Ministers. However, even if there was a remote possibility of President being a dictator, it has gone by the Forty-second Amendment Act of the Constitution.\n",
      "In the end, we can say that the position of the President of India is not so strong and real as it appears to be. In fact, he is only a titular head and enjoys the same position as the King under the English constitution. He is a dignified head of the state; his position is of great influence, though not of authority.\n",
      "real position of the president and his importance\n",
      "Real Position of the President of Indian Republic: Although the President of India cannot become a dictator in any circumstances, yet at the same time he is not as weak as the King of Britain. The King of Britain is so much under the Council of Ministers that if there is a conflict with his Council of Minister, this may lead even to the end of Monarchy from England. But so is not the case in India. In India, the Council of Ministers may be able to remove the President from his post but it is not possible for it to abolish the post of the President of Indian Republic. Had the framers of Indian Constitution intended to make the President of India just like the king of Britain, they would have provided that each order of the President must contain the signature of some or the other Minister. Since they did not make any such provision in the Constitution, it is quite obvious that they did not intend to make Indian President just like a seal of rubber.\n",
      "The Indian Constitution has conferred so vast powers upon the President that are not found in the Constitutions of other countries having Parliament system of Government. The President of Indian Republic can send messages to the parliament. In case of some controversy on some question, he can send back to Parliament any bill, of course except the money bill, for re-consideration. However, according to 42nd Amendment Act, he is bound to accept the advice of Council of Ministers.\n",
      "The emergency powers of the President of Indian Republic also make him stronger than the King of Britain. In Britain, the Parliament is entitled to suspend the Fundamental Rights of the citizens and this power does not vest in the Executive. But in India, the situation is different. It is true that when the President suspends the Fundamental Rights of the citizens, he will have to seek approval of the Parliament, but he does possess the power to do so without the approval or consent of the Parliament.\n",
      "Further, the President of Indian Republic is not the head of the Executive only in name. It is not proper to say that he reigns but does not rule. In ordinary conditions, it is true that he does not interfere in the administration but in certain specific circumstances he begins to do so. No provision of the Constitution can check him to do so. As a matter of fact, the real position of the President depends upon his own personality. He can certainly influence the Council of Ministers through his personality. If in practice, he does not rule, he can at least ensure the carrying on of good administration. It is still in store as to what form the Presidentship of Indian Republic will assume in future. Nothing can be definitely said in this connection. A scholar has aptly remarked. “It is very difficult to foresee the correct position which only future experience can show...”\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "The post of the President of Indian Union is very important. The President has to perform certain functions which greatly enhance his significance. He is the symbol of the nation in foreign countries and his voice is the voice of nation. He inculcates the qualities of patriotism, sacrifice, unity and organisation among the people and creates national feeling among them. The President of India is the symbol of national unity as well. He is the defender of the democracy. The President of the nation is the only man who is shown utmost respect and faith by the people. He is above party-politics and one voice in the country, the President is fully capable of defending the country. In difficult and disturbed times, the President provides stability to Government and nation by taking in his own hand the whole administration of the country and defending the country from civil war and internal disturbances. Lastly the post of the President is of great significance for achieving harmony and synthesis of the administrative system.\n",

      "LESSON – 6\n",
      "THE VICE – PRESIDENT\n",

      "To explain about the qualifications, election procedure, powers and functions of the President.\n",
      "Structure\n",
      "Election and Qualification – Term – Functions - Removal\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The Vice President occupies the second highest office in the country. He is accorded a rank next to the President in the official warrant of precedence. This office is modelled on the line of the American President.\n",
      "Election and Qualification \n",
      "The Vice Presidnet is elected not directly by the people but by the method of indirect election. He is elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of the members of both Houses of Parliament. Thus, this electoral college is different from the electoral college for the election of the President in the following two respects: \n",
      "It consists of both elected and nominated members of the Parliament (in the case of President, only elected members)\n",
      "It does not include the members of the state legislative assemblies (in the case of President, the elected members of the state legislative assemblies are included). \n",
      "Explaining the reason for the difference, Dr.B.R.Ambedkar observed:\n",
      "“The President is the head of the state and his power extends both to the administration both to the administration by the Centre as well as to the states. Consequently, it is necessary that in his election, not only members of Parliament should play their part, but the members of the state legislatures should have a voice. But when we come to the Vice-President, his normal functions are to preside over the council of states. It is only on a reare occasion, and tat too for a temporary period, that he may be called upon to assume the duties of the president. That being so, it does not seem necessary that the members of the state legislatures should also be invited to take part in the election of the Vice-President”.\n",
      "Indian Constitution has made provision for a Vice-President along with the President. He is elected by an electoral college consisting of the members of both the Houses of Parliament. He is elected by secret ballot and by single transferable vote. A candidate for the post of Vice-President must have these qualifications, (1) He must be a citizen of India, (2) His age must not have been less than 35 years; and (3) He must have necessary qualifications to become a member of the Rajya Sabha.\n",
      "Term \n",
      "The Vice-President is elected for a term of 5 years but he can resign even before the expiry of his term The Vice-President may also be removed if a resolution to this effect is passed by Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha also approves it.\n",
      "Functions\n",
      "The Vice President is an ex-officio Chairman of the Council of State or Rajya Sabha. The functions which are performed by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, are also performed by the Vice-President as Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. He has the onerous responsibility of conducting properly the meetings of the Rajya Sabha. If the President falls sick or dies or resigns or his post becomes vacant due to his removal, the Vice-President acts as officiating President till a new President is elected. During this period, he assumes all the powers and functions of the President the Vice-president can work as acting President for a maximum period of six months, during which the election of the new President must be completed.\n",
      "Removal\n",
      "The Vice-President can be removed from the office before expiry of his term. He may be removed from the office by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha passed by a majority of all the members and agreed to by the House of People or the Lok Sabha. However, before moving such a resolution atleast fourteen days notice is required.\n",

      "LESSON – 7\n",
      "THE PRIME MINISTER AND COUNCIL OF MINISTERS\n",
      "Objectives\n",
      "To acquaint with the powers and functions of the Prime Minister and the  Council of Ministers\n",
      "Structure\n",
      "Appointment of the Prime Minister- Powers and functions of the Prime Minister – Real Position of the Prime Minister – Council of Ministers\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "In parliamentary system of Government, the position of the Prime Minister is of great importance. Indian Constitution only provides that there shall be a Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister to aid and advise the President in his functions, who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice. But these words do not indicate the real position of the Prime Minister. To a great extent, the Prime Minister of India holds a powerful position like the Prime Minister of England Different scholars have expressed their views in regard to position of the British Prime Minister In the words of Lord Morley, “Prime Minister is the key-stone of the Cabinet arch.” According to Ramsay Muir, “The Cabinet is the steering wheel of the State and the Prime Minister is the steerman.” Scholars are of the opinion that similar views may also be expressed in regard to the Prime Minister of India. However, it must be admitted that the Prime Minister of England certainly holds comparatively more powerful position than the Prime Minister of India.\n",
      "Appointment of the Prime Minister \n",
      "The appointment of a Prime Minister is made by the President. After the general elections, the leader of the majority party in the House of People is appointed the Prime Minister of India by the President. Although Constitution nowhere provides specifically that the President shall have to appoint the leader of the majority party in Lok Sabha the Prime Minister of India, yet in practice the President cannot but appoint the leader of the majority party as the Prime Minister of India, because if it is not done so, it will be very difficult to carry on the administration of the country. However, the election of the Prime Minister can be challenged in any court of law.\n",
      "Powers and Functionsof the Prime Minister: Briefly, the duties and rights of the Prime Minister of India are as follows:\n",
      "Formation of Cabinet: The Union Cabinet consists of a Prime Minister and such other Ministers as may be necessary. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and other Ministers too are appointed by him on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister submits a list of the Ministers to the President, who accepts it. Thus, the Prime Minister has a right to select his colleagues and to distribute different portfolios to them. He is entitled to make any change in the Cabinet at any time he pleases. No person can remain a Minister without his will. He can ask any Minister to resign. In case that Minister refuses to resign, he can dissolve the whole Cabinet and reconstitute the Cabinet in which he may not keep the said Minister. Thus, the life of the Cabinet depends upon the pleasure of the Prime Minister, who can dissolve it at any time he pleases. If the Prime Minister resigns, the whole cabinet has to resign.\n",
      "Administration Powers: All the administration powers of the Cabinet may be said to those of the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister who distributes the whole administrative works into different departments and entrusts them to the suitable ministers. He determines and lays down the policies of the Government and plays a prominent role in their implementation. He establishes co-ordination among the different departments of the administration and gives directions to the Ministers and Government officials from time to time. He plays a prominent role in the appointment of important officials. He also contributes a significant role in determining and laying down the foreign policies.\n",
      "Law-making Functions: The Prime-Minister has a right to interfere in Cabinet's power of making laws. Without his prior advice or permission, no Bill can be presented in the Parliament.\n",
      "Chairmanship of Cabinet: The Prime Minister is the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and is fully responsible for all the works performed by his Ministers. He is the chief spokesman of the policies of the administration. All the important declarations regarding the working and programme of the House of People are made by him.\n",
      "Leadership of the House of People: The Prime Minister is not only the leader of the majority party in the House of People but is also the leader of the whole House of the People. If necessary, he may advise the President to dissolve the House of People and the President has to accept his advice. This power of the Prime Minister creates a terror in the member of the Parliament.\n",
      "Determining and laying down of foreign policy: The Prime Minister of India also plays a prominent role in determining and laying down of foreign policy. He holds talks with the prominent politicians that come from foreign countries. Besides this, he also determines and lays down the policy of the nation towards foreign countries.\n",
      "From the above discussion, it is evident that the Prime Minister of India enjoys and exercises vast powers. However, the exercise of these vast powers do not mean that he may become a dictator. In fact, he is the accepted leader of a democratic State and exercise his powers for the good and welfare of the people.\n",
      "It is the duty of the Prime Minister to provide a clear and efficient administration in the country so as to ensure the welfare of the people. He has grave responsibility of establishing harmony and co-ordination among the different departments of the administration. He and his Cabinet are collectively responsible to the House of People.\n",
      "Real Position of the Prime Minister: The Prime Minister holds a very prominent position in the administration. He is the maker of the Cabinet, head of the Executive, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, real head of the administration, an important link between the Cabinet and President, the leader of the House of People. The whole nation looks forward to the Prime Minister for guidance. However, it should not be understood that he is the dictator and can do what he likes. On the contrary, only that Prime Minister can be successful, who respects the will of the people, who consider the welfare of the people as his own welfare and who always works for the good and welfare of the people.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "About the position of the Prime Minister, Dr Ambedkar aptly observed, “Collective responsibility can be achieved only through the instrumentality of the Prime Minister ... Therefore, the Prime Minister is ihe key stone of the arch of the Cabinet and unless and until we create that office and endow that office with statutory authority to nominate and dismiss ministers, there can be no collective responsibility.”\n",
      "THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Article 74 (1) lays down, “There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head to aid and advice the President in the exercise of his functions.” After the 42nd Amendment, 1976, the Language of Art, 74 (1) is as follows: “There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head to aid and advice the President who shall, in exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice.”\n",
      "Composition \n",
      "Appointment of the Prime Minister and Other Ministers: The Constitution of India has not discussed in detail the composition and organization of the cabinet. It only provides that there shall be Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister to aid and advise the President who shall, in exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice. Article 75 lays down the manner in which the Council is to be set-up. After the election the President invites the leader of the majority party in the House of People to form the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister has full freedom to select his colleagues. He can select any person to become the Minister. After selecting his colleagues, the Prime Minister sends the list of names to the President, who accords his approval on it. If the Prime Minister so desires, he may recommend any such person who is not member of the Parliament to become a member of the Council of Ministers, but such person must become a member of either House of the Parliament within six months after his appointment as Minister.\n",
      "Qualifications \n",
      "Any citizen who is not otherwise disqualified, can be appointed as a Minister. Ordinarily, the Ministers are appointed from amongst the members of the Parliament. If a person, who is not a member of the Parliament, is appointed as a Minister, he will have to become a member of the Parliament within six months from the date of his appointment otherwise he will have to resign from his post.\n",
      "Kinds of Ministers: The Ministers have been divided into three categories: \n",
      "(i) Cabinet Ministers, (ii) State Ministers, and (iii) Deputy Ministers. The Cabinet Ministers participate in all the meetings of the Cabinet and express their views, whereas the State Ministers and Deputy Ministers, who work under the guidance and subordination of Cabinet Ministers, do not part in everyday meetings. Before occupying the post of Minister, every person appointed as Minister, has to take the oath of his post, which is administered by the President. The Ministers get salary and allowances as determined by the Parliament from time to time. Besides, they also get free residential bungalows.\n",
      "Functions \n",
      "Cabinet is the real executive and performs all the functions in the name of the President. The functions of the Cabinet can be divided into following categories:\n",
      "Functions relating to the making of laws: Mostly the Cabinet presents the Bills in the Parliament and also completes the procedures relating to the making of laws.\n",
      "Administrative functions: The Cabinet performs the key role so far as the administration of the whole country is concerned. The main administrative functions of the Cabinet are: (i) To divide the whole administrative works into different departments and entrust them to suitable Ministers; (ii) To lay down the policy of the Government and also to implement it; (iii) To furnish the information regarding administrative subjects and the question asked by the President, (iv) To give directions to Government servants from time to time; and (v) To., establish co-ordination among different departments of the administration.\n",
      "Financial Functions: The Cabinet presents the annual budget in the Parliament. The imposition of new tax, the fixation of its rates and the abolition of taxes are also the functions of the Cabinet.\n",
      "Important Appointments: In principle, the power to appoint the Governors, Judges, Ambassadors etc., is that of the President, but in practice he exercises his power in this respect on the advice of the Cabinet.\n",
      "Business of the Parliament: All the Government issues to be presented in the Parliament are decided by the Cabinet. The Cabinet also determines as to how much time should be fixed for a particular issue.\n",
      "Determination of foreign policy: The Cabinet also determines the foreign policy of the nation. The appointment of Ambassadors, signing of treaties of war or peace with foreign countries etc., are also done by the President on the advice of the Cabinet.\n",
      "Functions in emergency: The Cabinet assumes vast powers in a state of emergency. During emergency, it can interfere in the functions of the Governors. It can also advise the President to dismiss the Ministry of a State and impose President rule.\n",
      "Working of the Cabinet\n",
      "The working of the Cabinet may be conveniently studied under following heads:\n",
      "Meetings: In order to carry on the administration properly, the Cabinet holds meetings from time to time. There is atleast one meeting of the Cabinet in a week. Mostly, unanimous decisions are taken in these meetings but if there is no unanimity, the decision may be taken by a simple majority.\n",
      "Committees of the Cabinet: In order to carry on its functions properly, the Cabinet forms different committees and sub-committees. The Cabinet takes decisions only after these committees submit their report to it.\n",
      "Secretariat of the Cabinet: The Cabinet has a separate Secretariat of its own. This Secretariat has a considerable number of officers, advisers and officials. The Secretariat prepares the agenda of the meetings of the Cabinet and sends notices of the meeting of the Cabinet. It is also the duty of the Secretariat to circulate the necessary memoranda and other drafts among the Ministers. It also puts into writing the decisions taken by the Cabinet and prepares the report of different committees.\n",
      "Importance of the Cabinet\n",
      "The Central Cabinet has great significance. In feet “The Cabinet .is the pivot, around which the whole political machinery revolves.” The Constitution has made the President the Head of the Executive, but in practice the real powers vest in the hands of the Cabinet. The Cabinet exercises all the constitutional rights in the name of the President and carries on administrative machinery. It enjoys not only unlimited executive powers, but as a consequence of its majority in the Parliament, it has great hand in legislation. Mostly, all the financial matters are initiated by the Cabinet and it plays a significant role in the preparation and passing of the annual budget of the nation. The appointment of the Governors, Judges of the Supreme Court and High Court etc., is also made by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. In emergency, its powers as well as significance further increases. The Cabinet plays a major role in dismissing the Ministries of the States. \n",
      "Central Cabinet \n",
      "Central Cabinet occupies a very significant place. The whole administrative machinery works on the indication of the Cabinet.\n",
      "relation of cabinet with president and the house of people\n",
      "Cabinet and the President-Articles 74 and 75 of the Constitution determine the relations between the Cabinet and the President. Before the Forty-second Amendment Act, Article 74 laid down, “There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President in the exercise of his functions.” Thus, it was only a advisory body. It was not written in the Constitution that the President shall be bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President is the head of the Executive and according to Article 74, the Council of Ministers was only to advice him. The position has been totally changed by the Forty-second Amendment Act. Now Article 74 reads, “There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice.” However, according to 44th Amendment Act, President can ask the Council of Ministers to reconsider such an advice but he shall act in accordance with the advice tendered after such reconsideration, Thus, now the President is bound to accept the advice of the Prime Minister or the Council of Ministers, No President of Indian Republic has ever refused to accept the advice of the Council of Ministers but there was an apprehension of it before the Forty-second Amendment Act. However, that apprehension is also gone. This, however, does not mean that the President has no influence upon the Cabinet, although the real position is that he is the head of the Executive only in name. The President can, of course, influence the policies of the Cabinet through his personality.\n",
      "Cabinet and the House of People\n",
      "The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the House of People. The principle of collectively responsibility signifies that the Council of Ministers is a body responsible to the Lok Sabha for the general conduct of affairs of the Government. The Council of Ministers work as a team and all decisions taken by the Cabinet are the joint decision of all its members. No matter whatever be their personal difference of opinion within the Cabinet, but once a decision has been taken, it is the duty of each and every Ministers to stand by it and support it by both in the legislature and outside.\n",
      "The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the House of People. If the house of people passes an vote of no-confidence against the whole Cabinet or any of its Minister, the whole Cabinet will have to resign. This check restrains the Cabinet from becoming wilful. The Parliament also determines the expenditure, which a Minister can incur upon his department. It may also reduce the salary of any Minister The Parliament can remove the Cabinet by resorting to any of these methods; (1) By passing a resolution of no-confidence against the Cabinet; (2) By passing a resolution of no-confidence against any Minister; (3) By passing a resolution of reduction of the salary of any Minister; (4) By rejecting any bill presented by the Cabinet; and (5) By passing a non-official resolution. All these powers are vested only in House of People or Lok Sabha.\n",
      "Though the Parliament can compel the Cabinet to resign by passing a resolution of no-confidence against it, yet the real position is quite different. It is not the House of People which is master of Cabinet, but it is the Cabinet, which is, in practice, the master of the House of People. There are several reasons for this position. Firstly, the party of the Cabinet is in majority in the House of People and consequently it gets done whatever it desires in the House of People. Secondly, in any difficult situation, the head of the Cabinet, i.e., the Prime Minister, is entitled to advise the President to dissolve the House of People It is on account of this power of the Prime Minister that the Cabinet exercise comparatively more control over the House of People.\n",
      "Thus, it is not the House of People, which controls the Cabinet, but it is the latter, which exercise more control over the former. But this does not mean that in India there is the dictatorship of the Cabinet. In India, it has become established convention that the Cabinet has always bowed before the House of People. There have been many occasions when the members of the opposition parties have compelled the Cabinet to change its decision. Moreover, when there is no absolute majority of the ruling party and it has to depend upon other parties for having the absolute majority, the control of House of People or Lok Sabha on the Cabinet further increases.\n",

      "THE UNION PARLIAMENT\n",
      "Objectives\n",
      "To know about the Parliament and its functions\n",
      "Structure\n",
      "Introduction – Council of States – House of People – Importance of the Loksabha – Powers and functions of the Parliament.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Article 79 of the Indian Constitution provides that there shall be a Parliament, consisting of the President and two Houses namely Council of States and House of People for the Union. Thus, the legislature of the Union of India consists of two Houses.\n",
      "Council of States or Rajya Sabha\n",
      "The upper house of the Union Parliament is called Rajya Sabha or the Council of States, which is a peitnanent House and not subject to dissolution, one-third of its members retiring every second year. Article 80 of the Constitution of India says, “The Council of States shall consists of:\n",
      "twelve members to be nominated by the President in accordance with provisions of clause (3); and\n",
      "not more than two hundred and thirty eight representatives of States (and of the Union Territories).”\n",
      "The allocation of seats in the Council of States to be filled by representatives of the States and of the Union Territories shall be in accordance with the provisions in that behalf contained in the Fourth Schedule,\n",
      "The members to be nominated by the President under subclause (a) of clause (i) shall consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following namely-literature, science, art and social service.\n",
      "The representatives of each State in the Council of States shall be elected by the elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the State in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.\n",
      "The representatives of the Union Territories, in the Council of States shall be chosen in such a manner as Parliament may by law prescribe.\n",
      "Qualifications of the Members: A member of Rajya Sabha must have the following qualifications; (a) He must be a citizen of India having the age of not less than 30 years; (b) He must have those qualifications, which are prescribed from time to time by the law of Parliament; and (c) He must not hold any office of profit in Central or State Government. In addition to these qualifications, he or she must not be insane, insolvent or otherwise disqualified by any other law of the Parliament, If some disqualification arise in case of any member after his election, then such members shall be deprived of his membership.\n",
      "Life of the Rajya Sabha\n",
      " The Rajya Sabha is a permanent House and is never dissolved. Its members are elected for a term of 6 years. One-third of its members retire after every two years and in their place new members are elected.\n",
      "Presiding Officers of the Rajya Sabha\n",
      "In order to conduct the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha, there is a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman. The Vice President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha. The Deputy Chairman is elected by Rajya Sabha from among its own members. The Deputy Chairman performs the functions of the Chairman in his absence or in case of his acting as President. The Deputy Chairman of the Council of State is elected for a term of 6 years, but he or she can be removed even before, by passing a resolution of no-confidence. A written notice of atleast fourteen days is necessary for presenting a resolution of no-confidence in the Council of States. The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha have the usual powers, belonging to the presiding officers of the legislative bodies, such as those of recognizing members to the floor, deciding points or order, maintaining order and relevancy in debates, putting questions, taking votes and announcing the result. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman get salary and allowances fixed by the Parliament.\n",
      "Quorum\n",
      "The quorum of the Rajya Sabha is one-tenth of the total number of members.\n",
      "Importance of Rajya Sabha as a second chamber\n",
      "The Constitution of India provides those powers to the Rajya Sabha, which are generally enjoyed by the House of Lords of England. On every Bill the consent or approval of the Rajya Sabha is necessary, but it cannot reject any Bill. it can utmost detain the Bill for some time to return it to Lok Sabha for reconsideration, however, no money bill can be returned to Lok Sabha for reconsideration and it should be passed. In fact, it has been provided in order to follow the established convention. As a matter of fact, Rajya Sabha is only a ceremonial body. A scholar has rightly remarked, “Our Council of States does not seem to have been created with any particular purpose beyond bringing the Constitution in line with prevailing fashion of bicameralism. In our country, the credit of Second Chamber has at no time been high, and it will not be surprising if the Council of States lives simply to serve as one of the ornamental parts of the Constitution.”\n",
      "House of the People or Lok Sabha\n",
      "Composition: \n",
      "On the basis of the House of Commons of England, Indian Constitution also provides a lower house, called the ‘Lok Sabha’ or the ‘House of People’. According to the Constitution, the House of People or Lok Sabha consists of not more than 525 members directiy elected by the voters in the States and not more than 20 members to represent the Union Territories and Tribal Areas, to be chosen in such a manuor as Parliament may provide by law. The members are directly elected on the basis of adult franchise from single member constituency.\n",
      "Every citizen of India, male or female, who is not less than 18 years of age and is not disqualified on the grounds of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime or corrampe of illegal practice is entitled to vote at election of the Lok Sabha.\n",
      "For the purpose of election of the Lok Sabha, each State is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of the constituency and the number or seats allotted to, so far as practicable, is the same throughout the State Each State is allotted a number of seats in Lok Sabha in such manner that ratio between that number and its population, so far as practicable is the same for all States. Clause (2) of Article 81, thus provides for uniformity of representation in two respects, (a) as between the State and (b) as between the different constituencies in the same State. The population for this purpose will be ascertained on the basis of the last preceding census. After the completion of each census (c) allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha to the States and (d) the division of each State into territorial constituencies shall be readjusted in such a manner as Parliament may law prescribe.\n",
      "There wilt be no re-adjustment of the territorial constituencies on the basis of new census till the year 2000, The re-adjustment of the constituencies may be taken up after the year 2000, and until this is done the allocations of seats in Lok Sabha will be done on basis of the 1971 census.\n",
      "Qualifications of the Members of the House of People\n",
      "A candidate for the membership of the House of People must have these qualities; (1) He must be a citizen of India, (2) He must have attained the age of 25 years, and (3) He must possess such other qualification as Parliament may prescribe by law.\n",

      "Right of Franchise for electing the Members of Lok Sabha\n",
      "In India, adult suffrage has been made the basis of the elections to the House of People. Every citizen who has attained the 18 years of age, irrespective of sex and educational or income qualifications, is entitled to vote, provided that he or she is free from disqualifications and has been ordinarily resident for not less than 180 days in the constituency. As regards the disqualifications, he must not be an alien, of unsound mind or convicted of crime or illegal practices or any other disqualifications, which may be provided by the Parliament from time to time.\n",
      "Term of the House of People\n",
      "The House of People or Lok Sabha shall continue for five years. Its term was enhanced to six years by 42nd Amendment Act but again reduced to five years by 44th Amendment Act. Thus, at present, it is five years. But during this period, it may be dissolved by the President if he is fully satisfied that there is a lack of representation of the people. Ordinarily, term of the house cannot be extended, but in case a proclamation of emergency has been made, the House of People can extend its term for one year. If the state of emergency continues for a long time, the House of People can extend its terms thrice for a period of one year each time.\n",
      "Quorum\n",
      "The quorum for the House of People is one-tenth of the total number of its members.\n",
      "Presiding Officers Of The House Of People\n",
      "The Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha are the presiding officers. They are sleeted by the House from among its members. The Speaker presides over the session of the House of People and conducts its business. In his absence, the Deputy Speaker performs his functions.\n",
      "Oath by the Members\n",
      "Before a candidate occupies his seat as a member of the House of People or the Council of States, he has to take an oath before the President or any person appointed by the President for this purpose.\n",
      "Rules regarding the Membership of the Parliament\n",
      "No person can become the member of both the House of the Parliament. If he is elected as the member of both the Houses, he shall have to leave the membership of one of the Houses. Likewise, no person can simultaneously become the member of the Legislative Assembly of any State as well as the member of either House of the Parliament. If he is elected as the member of both of them, he shall have to leave the membership of either of them. If a member remains absent continuously for 60 days without permission, he may be deprived of the membership of the Parliament or a person, who is not a member of the Parliament, sits and votes in the Parliament, he shall have to pay a fine of Rs 500 per day for as many days as he sits and acts in this manner. \n",
      "Pay, Allowances and Privileges of the Members of Parliament\n",
      "The members of the Parliament get pay and allowance in accordance with the rules made by the Parliament. Moreover, each member of the Parliament gets free railway pass to travel to any part of the country. Each member of Parliament has full freedom to speak in Parliament subject to the rules and directions made by the Parliament itself in this connection. No action can be taken in any court against a member of the Parliament for having said anything in the Parliament or in any of its Committees.\n",
      "Importance of the Lok Sabha\n",
      "Lok Sabha is the directly representative body of the people. It has contributed a tot to the success of the democracy in India. Regarding the functions and importance of the Lok Sabha, a scholar has aptly remarked, “As the directly representative body of the people, it can speak in their name and express their wishes with an authority; which no other organ of the Government can command. If the Parliament is the Supreme organ of the State, the House of People is the supreme organ of Parliament. Its will, when emphatically declared must, therefore, be respected and followed by every other authority in the State.”\n",
      "Privileges and Immunities\n",
      "Both the houses of Parliament as well as of a State Legislature have similar privileges under our constitution.\n",
      "The privileges of each House may be divided into two groups: (1) those which are enjoyed by members individually and (2) those which belong to each of House of Parliament as a collectively body.\n",
      "The following are the privileges enjoyed by the members individually: (i) freedom from arrest, (ii) freedom from attendance as witness and (iii) freedom of speech.\n",
      "Freedom from arrest: A member cannot be arrested during the continuance of a meeting of the Chamber or Committee thereof which he is a member and during a period of 40 days before and after such meeting or sitting. However, this immunity is confined to arrest in civil cases and does not extend to arrest in criminal cases or under the law of preventive detention.\n",
      "Freedom from Attendance as Witness: A member can not be summoned, without the leave of the House, to give evidence as a witness while Parliament is in session.\n",
      "Freedom of Speech: There will be freedom of speech within the walls of each House. No court can take any action against any thing said in the House. But this does not mean unrestricted license to speak anv thing that a member may like, regardless of the dignity of the House.\n",
      "The privileges of the House collectively are: (i) the right to publish debates and proceedings and the rights to restrain publication by others; (ii) the right to exclude others; (iii) the right to regulate the internal affairs of the House and decide matters arising within walls; (iv) the right to publish Parliamentary misbehavious; and (v) the right to punish members and outsiders for breach of its privileges.\n",
      "The members of either House of Parliament are entitled to receive such salaries and allowances as may from time to time be determined by Parliament.\n",
      "Powers and Functions of the Parliament: Leaving aside a few issues, Indian Parliament is the most powerful body. In brief, the different powers and functions of Indian Parliament are as follows:-\n",
      "Legislative Powers of the Parliament: Indian Parliament has been given a lot of powers for making laws of the country. The Constitution has empowered the Parliament to legislate on all the subjects of the Union and the Concurrent Lists and, under certain specified circumstances, also the subjects of the State List. The Parliament has also been given power to legislate on all residuary subjects. However, certain provisions of the Constitution have limited the legislative powers of the Parliament. For instance, Indian Parliament can not make laws depriving the citizens of their Fundamental Rights. It can also not make a law, which is repugnant to or contravenes any provision of the Constitution. The Supreme Court can declare null and void any such law made by the Parliament.\n",
      "Administrative Powers or Control over Executive: It is also the function of the Parliament to-see whether the laws made by it are being properly implemented or not and whether the Executive is working in accordance with the rules made by it. The powers of the Central Executive vests in the Cabinet and the Parliament contribute a significant role in the Constitution. The Parliament exercises control over the Cabinet and the Executive by adopting any of these ways (a) Resolution of No-confidence; (b) Resolution of condemnation or stop-work resolution; (c) Orders or directions for the investigation of Government works; (d) Criticism of the budget; (e) Right to debate and discus Government Bills; and (f) Right to ask question. Thus, Parliament exercises its full control over the Executive and that is why it has been rightly called powerful body. However, it can exercise its control properly over the Executive only when the opposition is strong.\n",
      "Financial Functions and powers: The Constitution has provided considerable financial powers to the Parliament. However, in the field of financial powers, the Lower House or Lok Sabha is comparatively far more powerful than the Upper House or the Rajya Sabha. The Constitution provides that a Money Bill can be initiated only in the Lok Sabha and after it is passed by the Lok Sabha, it is sent to the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha also passes it after the due discussion. Rajya Sabha cannot detain it for more than 14 days. The Parliament is empowered to approve the national budget presented by the Government. It can approve as well as reject the budget. The Finance Minister of the Central Government presents the annual budget in the Lok Sabha along with the recommendations of the President. Leaving aside the expenditure from the consolidated Fund of India, the Parliament can deduct, stop or reject the demand of expenditure on any other any item. It can also impose restrictions in regard to the imposition of new taxes. Through the Public Accounts Committee, the Parliament also exercises control over the manner in which funds granted by it are spent.\n",
      "Power to amend the Constitution: Parliament is the only body, which can amend the constitution. However, it is provided that the Constitution can be ended only when a resolution for amending the Constitution is passed by majority of total members of both the House and two-third of the members present and voting.\n",
      "Right to elect the President and the Vice-President: The Parliament is also entitled to take part in the election of the President and the Vice-President. The President is elected by the members of the Parliament and the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies. The election of the Vice-President is, however, made by the members of both the Houses of Parliament.\n",
      "Other Powers: In addition to the above mentioned powers. There are several other powers of the Parliament. The Parliament is entitled to investigate the charge of impeachment of the President. It is also entitled to cause the removal of the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court, and Auditor General etc. It is also the right to determine and fix the pay and allowances, qualifications etc, of the Government officials, members of Parliament etc.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "No doubt, the powers of the Indian Parliament are very vast, yet there is the supremacy of Parliament in our country. In India, there is the supremacy of Indian Constitution. There are certain provisions in the Constitution of India, which serve as cheek upon the powers of Parliament and check it from becoming willful or supreme like the parliament of England. \n",

      "THE JUDICIARY: THE SUPREME COURT AS THE APEX COURT\n",
      "Objectives\n",
      "1. To know about the salient features of Indian Judiciary.\n",
      "2. To have a knowledge about the composition and powers of supreme court of India.\n",
      "Structure\n",
      "Introduction - salient features of the Indian Judiciary – Supreme Court of India – Summary.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "In India, there is a Supreme Court with a High Court for each state which is subordinate to the Supreme Court and below High Court are the District Courts. In India, judiciary has been constituted on the lines of Judiciary of England but the good points of the judiciary of other prominent countries have also been adopted. The Constitution of India has made provisions for a unified judiciary and one system of fundamental law. The judiciary has been given a very significant and glorious position in order to safeguard liberty and freedom of the citizens.\n",
      "The salient features of the Indian Judiciary \n",
      "(1) Independent Judiciary: \n",
      "The Judiciary of India is completely free from the influence of the Executive and Legislature.lt is true that the appointment of judges is made by the President but once they are appointed, they cannot be removed from their posts without the impeachment, which is required to be presented in the Legislature as prescribed under the Constitution. During the tenure of office,the salary of judges cannot be reduced.\n",
      "(2) Organised Judiciary: \n",
      "Indian Judiciary is very well knit and integrated one. From top to the bottom, all the Courts are connected with each other. At the appex of the whole system, there is a Supreme Court situated at the capital of the country. Below the Supreme Court of India, there is a High Court in each State and below it there are District Courts and other Subordinate Courts. All the courts of the country are thus connected with each other and they perform their functions in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws made by the Parliament and the State Legislatures.\n",
      "(3) A Judicial System similar to that of Britain :\n",
      "India’s Judicial system is, to a great extent, similar to that of Britain. In India, there is a unified Judiciary and one system of fundamental law. Like Britain, Indian Constitution has endeavoured to establish the “rule of law” in the country. i.e., equality before law.\n",
      "(4) Mainly two types of Courts: \n",
      "In India, there are mainly two types of courts-civil and criminal. Unlikesome other countries, there are no administrative courts in our country.\n",
      "(5) Higher authority of Judiciary :\n",
      "In India, Executive, Legislative and Judiciary have their own importance, but in certain fields the significance of the Judiciary is much more than the Executive and the Legislature. In India, there is supremacy of the Constitution. None has the right to contravene the provisions of the Constitution. The Judiciary of India is the guardian of the Constitution. Any law passed by the Parliament or the State Legislature contravening the provisions of the Constitution, can be declared ultra vires by the Judiciary. Thus, there is higher authority of Judiciary and the Executive and the Legislature cannot do anything against the will of the Judiciary.\n",
      "supreme court of india\n",
      "The Constitution provides that there shall be a Supreme Court of India. It is the highest federal court and stands at the apex of our judicial system. It is the final interpreter and the guardian of the Constitution and its chief function is not to let the Union and State violate the provisions of the Constitution. The Supreme Court also has general powers of judicial superintendence over all the Court of India.\n",
      "Composition of the Supreme Court\n",
      "In accordance with Article-124 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court of India consists of the Chief Justice not more than 17 other judges. The number of the Judges can be increased by a law of Parliament. The appointment of the Chief Justice and other Judges is made by the President. In this connection the President may seek the advice of such Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States, as he think necessary. According to Article 124(2), the chief Justice of India must always be consulted by the President in the appointment of the associate Judges of the Supreme Court. Adhoc Judges may be appointed by the Chief Justice of India with the previous consent of the President from among the duly qualified judges of any High Courts for such period as may be necessary. In making an Adhoc appointment of this kind, the Chief Justice of India must act in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court from which the appointment is proposed to be made.\n",
      "A retired Judge of the Supreme Court may, with the previous consent of the President and his own consent, be requested by the Chief Justice of India to sit and act as a Judge of the Supreme Court at any time.\n",
      "Article 130 provides for the seat of the Supreme Court. It reads, “The Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or in such other places, as the Chief Justice of India may, with the approval of the President, from time to time, appoint.”\n",
      "Qualifications of the Judges: \n",
      "According to Article 124 person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court unless he is a citizen of India (a) has been for at least five years a Judge of High Court or of two or more such Courts in succession  or (b) has been for at least ten years an advocate of a High Court or of two or more such Courts in succession; or (c) is, in the opinion of the President, a distinguished jurist.\n",
      "Term and Removal :\n",
      "Judge of the Supreme Court holds office till the age of 65 years and thereafter he is relieved of his duties and receives pension. However, even before the expiry of his term, he may resign by writing under his hand addressed to the President. A Judge of the Supreme Court cannot be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by majority of not less than two-third of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. According to Article 124 (7), no person who has held office as a Judge of the Supreme Court shall plead or act in any Court or before any authority within territory of India.\n",
      "Salary and Allowances: \n",
      "The Chief Justice and other Judges of the Supreme Court get the salary, allowances and facilities provided by the Constitution and amended from time to time by the Parliament. The salary and the allowances of the Supreme Court Judges can be changed by the Parliament by making resolution in this connection, but the salary and allowances of a Supreme Court Judge cannot be changed to his disadvantage during his term.\n",
      "Jurisdiction and Powers of the Supreme Court \n",
      "Since the Supreme Court is the highest Court in India, the Constitution has confermed the widest powers upon it. A scholar has rightly remarked, “The Supreme Court of Indian Union has more powers than any Supreme Court of the world.” It has original as well as appellate jurisdiction. Article 129 makes it a court of record with the power to punish for contempt of itself. The powers and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court may be divided under the following heads:\n",
      "1. Original jurisdiction: \n",
      "Under Article 131 of the Constitution the Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide any dispute- (a) between the Government of India and one or more States, or (b) between the Government of India and any State on one side and one and more other States on other; or (c) between two or more States; if and in so far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal rights depends. The Supreme Courts in its original jurisdiction cannot entertain any suit brought by private individuals against the Government of India. The dispute relating to the original jurisdiction of the Court must involve question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence of a legal right depends.\n",
      "“Article (l) lays down that all the doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President or Vice-President shall be inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision shall be final”.\n",
      "(2) \tAppellate Jurisdiction: \n",
      "Under its appellate jurisdiction, the Supreme Carts hears appeals against the decisions of the High Courts. The appelate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court may be divided into the following three categories:\n",
      "Appeals in Constitutional matters: An appeal lies to the Supreme Court in any proceedings if the High Court certifies that a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution is involved. Even where the High Court has refused to give such a certificate, the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law as to an interpretation of the Constitution, grant a special leave to appeal from such judgment, decree of final order.\n",
      "Civil Appeals: Under Article 133 of the Constitution, an appeal shall lie to-the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India if the High Coot certifies that\n",
      "The amount or value of the Subject matter in dispute is not less than rupees one lakh, or such sum as may be specified by Parliament.\n",
      "That the judgment involves a claim or question respecting property of tie like amount, or\n",
      "That the case is fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court.\n",
      "(iii) Criminal Appeals: Under Article 134, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any judgment, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India if the High Court :\n",
      "has an appeal reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death; or\n",
      "has withdrawn for trial before itself and case from any Court subordinate to its authority and has in such trial convicted the accused person and sentenced him to death; or\n",
      "certifies that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court.\n",
      "(3) Special Leave to Appeal: In accordance with the provisions of Article 136(1) of the Constitution, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree determination, sentence or order in any case or matter passed or made by any Court or Tribunal in the territory of India. However, nothing in clause in 136(1) shall apply to any judgment, determination, sentence or order passed or made by any Court to Tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces.\n",
      "(4) Advisory Jurisdiction: Article 143 of the Constitution confers advisory jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court. According to this provision, if at any time the President thinks that a question of law or fact has arisen or is likely to arise, which is such of a nature and of public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court, he may refer the question to the Supreme Court for consideration and the Supreme Court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon. It may, however, be noted that neither the Supreme Court is bound to give the opinion of the Supreme Court. Despite this the opinion of the Supreme Court is given the highest respect and so far it has never been disregarded.\n",
      "(5) Jurisdiction of Transfer of Cases: Article 139 (A) of the Constitution lays down “(1) Where cases involving the same are substantially the same question of law are pending before the Supreme Court and one or more High Courts and Supreme Courts is satisfied on its own motion or on an application made by the Attorney General of India or by a party to any such case that such questions are substantial questions of general importance, the Supreme Court may withdraw the case or cases pending before the High Court or the High Courts and dispose of all the cases itself:\n",
      "(1) Provided that the Supreme Court may, after determining the said question of law return any case so withdrawn together with a copy of its judgment on such questions to the High Court from which the case has been withdrawn, and the High Court shall on receipt thereof proceed to dispose of the case in conformity with such judgment.\n",
      "(2) The Supreme Court may, if it deems it expedient so to do for the ends of justice, transfer any case, appeal or other proceedings also pending before any court to any other High Court.\n",
      "(6) \tOther Powers and Functions: \n",
      "The Constitution provides that the decisions of the Supreme Court shall be binding on all Courts within the territory of India. In addition to the above mentioned powers and functions, the Supreme Court has other powers and functions which are as follows:\n",
      "Investigation and Inspection of Subordinate Courts: The Supreme Court has a right to inspect and investigate all the courts, which are subordinate to it.\n",
      "Protector of the Fundamental Rights of Citizens: The Supreme Court of India is also the protector of the fundamental rights of citizens. Article 32 of the Constitution lays down that the Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions as orders or writs including writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo-Warrrauto and Certiorai for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights of citizens.\n",
      "To declare ultra vires any law passed by the Parliament: If any law passed by the Parliament contravenes the provisions of the Constitutions, it may be declared ultra vires by the Supreme Court of India.\n",
      "To make rules for the working of the courts: The Supreme court is also entitled to frame rules for the working of the Courts subordinate to it. However, the consent of the President is necessary for the enforcement of all such rules.\n",
      "Working of the Supreme Court\n",
      "The Supreme Court of India has wide powers to make rules and to regulate its own procedure and practice. All cases, in which some substantial questions of law in regard to the interpretation of the Constitution are involved, must be heard by a bench consisting five judges according to 42nd Amendment Act. All other cases may be heard by a single judge or such number of judges, as may be prescribed by the rules of the Court. All the decisions are taken by a majority of the judges constituting the bench, but if a judge or more than one judge disagrees with the majority opinion, he may give a dissenting judgement. All the judgements and opinions of the Courts are delivered in open court.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "The Supreme Court of India is completely independent and impartial. In order to maintain the independence and impartiality of this Court, the terms of the judges have been determined by the Constitution. The salary and allowances of a judge of Supreme Court cannot be reduced during his term. The salaries and allowance of the judges of the Supreme Court are paid out of the Consolidated Fund of India, which is not subject to voting in the Parliament. The judges of the Supreme Court can be removed from their office, but for this purpose a special and difficult procedure has to be followed. during the term of the judges, any change in the conditions of their service which is disadvantageous to them, cannot be made. Thus, the Constitution has endeavoured to keep the Supreme Court of India free from the influence of the Executive and Legislature.\n",

      "LESSON -10\n",
      "THE POWER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW\n",
      "Concept of judicial review \n",
      "The literal meaning of the word ‘review’ means an act of inspecting or examining something with a view to correct it or to improve it. It shows that there is something which has already been done by somebody whose correction or improvement is envisaged in the process of ‘review’. The phrase ‘judicial review’ means to examine the validity or correctness of the action of some other agency by a court. Thus, ‘judicial Review’ may be described as the power of the judiciary to review and determine the validity of a law or an order. It means that the constitution is the supreme law of the land and any law inconsistent therewith is void.\n",
      "‘Judicial Review’ of legislative or executive action is defined as “Judicial review is the ultimate power of any court to declare any act of legislatures or of executives as unconstitutional and hence unenforceable as a) any law b) any official action based upon a law and c) any other action by a public official that it deems to be in conflict with theconstitution.”\n",
      "In L. Chandra Kumar Vs Union of India the Supreme Court held that “Henry J. Abraham’s definition of judicial review in the American constitution is, subject to a few modifications, equally applicable to the concept as it is understood in Indian constitutional law. Broadly speaking judicial review in India comprises three aspects i.e. judicial review of legislative action, judicial review of judicial decisions and judicial review of administrative action.”\n",
      "According to an American author, Howard Mebain, judicial review means the power possessed by American courts to declare that legislative and executive action are null and void if they are violative of the writtenconstitution.\n",
      "Scope of judicial review -\n",
      "In countries like U.S.A and India, which has a Federal system of government, there is a division of functions between the central government and the state government. Such a division of functions is an essential feature of federal system, and the process of judicial review enables the courts responsible for enforcing the provisions of the constitution, statute and the rules of the federal system. This power necessarily includes an authority to declare any provision as ultra virus if any state legislation or other action of the instrumentality of the state infringes the constitutional authority of the central government or any other state in the federation. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India and the U.S.A. has got power to declare the acts of parliament and congress unconstitutional respectively. Courts call it as the judicial review over the acts of the legislative and executive departments of the government. The courts have power to declare actions of the other two wings invalid if they are contrary to the constitutional law. This system is termed as ‘Judicialsupremacy’.\n",
      "This kind of power is enjoyed by the Indian and American courts. No such power is resided in the highest courts of England, France, Russia and Switzerland. The principle of judicial review is considered as an essential feature of written constitutions of many countries. H.M.Seervai, in his book Constitutional Law of India mentioned that the principle of judicial review is a familiar feature of the constitutions of Canada, Australia and India, though the doctrine of separation of powers is not mentioned in strict sense under Indian constitution, but the functions of different organs of the government have been sufficiently differentiated, so that one organ of the government could not usurp the functions of another. American constitutional writes say that it is judicial enforcement alone which makes the provisions of the American constitution more than mere maxims of political morality.\n",
      "It is said regarding the judicial review in America that: “The power of judicial review is based on the idea that the constitution created a government of limited powers.” Same is the condition with the Indian constitution also.\n",
      "In Australia, when the Federal constitution was to be established at the Convention of 1891, Cockburn spoke of the necessity of judicial review in Federalism as “all our experience hitherto has been under the condition of parliamentary sovereignty. Parliament has been the Supreme body. But when we embark on federation, we throw parliamentary sovereignty overboard, parliament is no longer supreme. When parliamentary sovereignty is dispensed with, instead of there being a High Court of parliament, you bring into existence a powerful judiciary which towers above all powers, legislative and executive and which is the sole arbiter and interpreter of theconstitution.”\n",
      "Procedure for judicial review:-\n",
      "The concept of separation of powers is an essential component of judicial review which is also a part of rule of law, which is a basic feature of the Indian constitution.\n",
      "Every state action has to be tested on the ground of rule of law and that exercise is performed, when a doubt was raised in that behalf, by the courts. Still the methods of judicial scrutiny are inadequate in India though the framers constitution of India inserted a specific provision under Article 32 of the constitution to go directly to the Supreme Court regarding legislative lapses concerned with infringement of fundamental rights. Article 32itself is the fundamental right and according to Dr Ambedkar “It is the soul of the constitution as without which there would be no meaning of inserting the other fundamental rights in the constitution”. But there has been no any specific provision incorporated under the constitution of India to seek remedy from the Supreme Court on the unconstitutionality arising out of the violation of the constitutional mandate relating to distribution of powers or separation of powers or other constitutional restrictions which is equally vital. The aggrieved party has to move first the High court under Article 226 and then only in appeal he can go to the Supreme Court if relief is not given by the High Court, if the issue does not involve infringement of fundamental rights guaranteed under part III of the constitution. Such pitfalls required to be rectificated by a suitable provision in the constitution so as to enable an aggrieved person to move the  Supreme Court in respect of the unconstitutionality relating to the distribution of powers or delegated legislation or other constitutional restriction. This speedy remedy will quicken the conscience of the citizen in a  more fruitful manner in protection of his rights. Thus the power of judicial review isenumeratedunderArticles226and227oftheconstitutionofIndiainsofaras\n",
      "\n",
      "the High Courts are concerned. In regard to the  Supreme Court Articles 32 and 136 of the constitution, the judiciary in India has come to control by way of judicial review of every aspect of governmental and public functions.\n",
      "Importance of judicial review:-\n",
      "Indian Constitution is federal in nature and it is the constitutional duty of the  Supreme Court to interpret the constitution. Judiciary keeps organs and departments of the government within their limits by judicial interpretations. Federal structure may be damaged in absence of the power of judicial review. Therefore, judicial review is an important ingredient of ourconstitution.\n",
      "It is true that judicial review keeps faith on judges and their ability and integrity. Judges are part and parcel of the society. Judiciary proved to be much more honest than legislature and executive. Judicial review protects our country from arbitrariness and tyranny of executive and legislature. In absence of judicial review and judicial activism, corrupt executive and legislatures would have spoilt moral and social life of thepeople.\n",
      "Legislature and executive are pressurized by vested interests whereas judiciary has less such chances of pressure from vestedinterests.\n",
      "Judicial review is democratic and keeps the democracy alive through keeping organs of state within their ownlimits.\n",
      "As observed by Justice Frankfurter, judiciary is accountable to the people the consumers of the justice\n",
      "Judicial review protects against legislative excesses and executive arbitrariness. The Indian judiciary is the best example of an umpire for deciding the proper functioning of the constitution. Judiciary saved the constitution anddemocracy.\n",
      "The judgments and orders of the  Supreme Court and High Courts are found generally well considered and balanced. Art. 137 of constitution of India empower the Supreme Court to review its own order or judgment. This power of correction makes the judiciary to correct its own mistakes. As per the change in circumstances and conditions and coming into existence of new facts  and laws the Supreme Court and High Court overrule and set aside their own judgments andorders.\n",
      "Thus, Justice Chandrachud in Bharti’s case held that judicial review as the basic structure of the constitution and is an essence of federal structure  of polity and democratic set-up of thecountry.\n",
      "Need of judicial review:-\n",
      "The future of any democratic country depends upon the preservation and maintenance of the rule of law. An important achievement of democracy is ‘law must be just for human safety and must be subservient to the human needs’. In order to establish an ideal democratic rule and to create confidence in the mind of the people about democratic federalism, a federal republican country must allow judicial review to thrive so as to eliminate unjust and unconstitutional laws and torelieve the people from legislative tyranny. This is an age of constitutional and limited democracy which imposes limitations on the power of the government and banks on majority rule to avoid tyranny and arbitrariness. But democracy cannot thrive in the absence of an all pervading justice. The preamble of the Indian constitution has bestowed equality and justice to all citizen of India and has the laws of India liable to be tested judicially as the absolute power leads to tyranny. So the existence of some impartial body is essential for the maintenance of democracy.\n",
      "Even Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who had a very large political and constitutional experience, said: “With all my admiration and love for democracy, I am not prepared to accept the statement that the largest number of people is always right.” The danger of oppression by majority is so obvious that the history of modern democracy is hunted by the ambition of including the minority in the controlling electoral body.” But this solution of inclusion of minority is not the real solution. The judicial review tried to relieve political tension and tyranny to a greater degree. The democratic aspect of judicial review has been summarized “If democracy means very simply that the majority is to have whatever it at present hankers after, then judicial review is an intrusive body in democracy. If democracy means that the majority is generally to have its way because human beings are to be respected and the conception of their own interests not disregarded, then the commitment of the majority to limits set by law is of the essence ofdemocracy”.\n",
      "B.K. Gokhale has enumerated the merits of judicial review in democracy:-\n",
      "Judges are competent to make judicial review by virtue of their knowledge and experience\n",
      "Courts are less biased thanlegislatures.\n",
      "It guarantees the rights ofminorities.\n",
      "It protects the rights if the individual and also those of the federal units in a federation.\n",
      "Judicial review in India:-\n",
      "The initial years of the Supreme Court of India adopted an approach characterized by caution and circumspection. The court generally adopted a pro- legislature stance being steeped in the British tradition of limited judicial review. This can be seen from the rulings such as A.K. Gopalan, but it did not take long for judges to break their shackles and this led to a series of right to property cases in which the judiciary was loggerhead with the parliament. The nation saw a series of events where a decision of the Supreme Court was followed by a legislation nullifying its effect, followed by another decision reaffirming the earlier position, and so on. The tussle between the two wings of government continued on other issues such as the power of amending the constitution. During this era, the legislature tried to bring forth people-oriented socialist measures which when in conflict with fundamental rights were frustrated on the upholding of the fundamental rights of individuals by the Supreme Court. At the time, an effort of criticism was made to project the Supreme Court as being concerned only with the interests of propertied classes and being insensitive towards the needs of the masses. Between 1950 and 1975, the Indian Supreme Court held a mere one hundred union and state laws, in whole or in part, to be unconstitutional.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "In the words of  Chief justice P.N Bhagwati “The judge infuses life and blood into the dry skeleton provided by the legislature and creates a living organism appropriate and adequate to meet the needs of the society”. These words of justice are worth mentioning because the role of judges is not only in interpreting the constitution strictly but also is to give the true meaning to the legislation. Judicial review generated its power from the constitution in India and the scope is very well described by the  supreme court of India from time totime.\n",
      "If we strictly go for the meaning of judicial review it is the check and balance of the Acts or laws made by the legislation by the judiciary on account of its being contrary to the constitution. No doubt the  Supreme Court of India is the final interpreter of the constitution as we can analyze it from many cases decided by it. It is playing a significant role as protector and working at its best since the commencement of the constitution. With its intellect and time the Supreme court achieved a lot more than bare rigid law interpreter made by the legislation. The  Supreme Court rendered hundreds of decisions expounding various provisions of the constitution, and, thus a distinct constitutional jurisprudence developed. Now with the help of its power of judicial review and judicial activism this court is actively focusing on the social welfare. It is the last resort for the weak sections of the society. But on the other hand it is criticized that this law making power in the hands of the judiciary is posing a threat to the state constitutionalism. India is following constitution and its spirit is to establish constitutionalism in the country. But it is further criticized that this power of the Supreme Court may lead to the country where judiciary could be the head. It could be synonymous of creating a third chamber of legislation, which is against the spirit of constitutionalism i.e. idea of limited government where an organ of the government can be checked on the ground of being arbitrary. Thus this power required to be exercised very cautiously. It is expected that court shall not exercise it arbitrarily. “Great powers bring great responsibilities” this quotation of some scholar can help the court while using its powers. But in spite of all these criticisms the doctrine of judicial review is recognized as the basic feature of the constitution.\n",
      "It appears to me that our judiciary has been playing a remarkable role by the way of judicial review for maintaining the supremacy of the constitution. As stated by Holmes that ‘life of law is not logic but experience.’ Hamilton, one of the framers of the constitution of United States of America says that if there is conflictbetweenconstitution and the law the judges should prefer constitution. In India it is reflected 100%. After the decision of Keshavananda Bharti’s case 42nd amendment was made to the constitution which inserted Clause 4 and 5 which declared that their shall be no limitation on the amending power of the parliament of what so ever. According to Mr. Swaran Singh, the Chairman, and Congress Committee on Constitutional Amendments, put an end to any controversy as to which is Supreme, parliament or the Supreme Court. But In Minerva  Mills v. Union of India28, The Supreme Court struck down Clauses (4)  and (5) of Article 368 inserted by the 42nd Amendment, on the ground that these clauses destroyed the essential feature of the basic structure of the constitution.  The Judgment of the Supreme Court thus makes it clear that “The Constitution-not the parliament is supreme inIndia.”\n",

      "THE GOVERNOR\n",
      "Appointment\n",
      "The Constitution provides that there shall be a Governor for each state. The appointment of the Governor is made by the President. He holds office during the pleasure of the President. Generally, the Governor is appointed in consultation with the Chief Minister of the State concerned. He is usually from outside the State, to which he is appointed. The Governor must have the following qualifications (1) He must be citizen of India; (2) He must have completed the age of 35 years; (3) He must not be a member of the Parliament or a State Legislature; and (4) He must not hold any office of profit in the Central or State Government.\n",
      "Salary and allowances\n",
      "The Constitution says that there shall also be paid to the Governors of the states such allowances as were payable to the Governors of the provinces immediately before the commencement of the Constitution. In addition to this, he gets a rent free official residence and other allowances and facilities. During (he tenure of office, his pay and allowances cannot be reduced.\n",
      "Term\n",
      "Generally, the Governor of the State is appointed by the President for a period of 5 years, but he may resign even before the expiry of his term by sending the letter of resignation to the President. He holds the office during the pleasure of the President, who may remove him at any time. The State Legislature has no power to remove the Governor\n",
      "Oath\n",
      "After his being appointed as the Governor, he is required to lake an oath of his office before the Chief Justice of the High Court of that State.\n",
      "Powers and Functions of the Governor\n",
      "Indian Constitution has conferred vast powers on the Governor of State. He is the constitutional head of his State just as the President is of the Union. All the executive works of the State are done in the name of the Governor. Here we are giving a brief account of the powers and functions of the Governor.\n",
      "1. Administrative Powers: The Governor is the head of the executive of the State and, therefore, all executive or administrative works of the State are done in his name. The Governor exercises all his administrative power on the advice of the State Cabinet. The Constitution has provided following administrative powers to a Governor of the State.\n",
      "(a) Appointment of the officials: The appointment of the Chief Minister and other Ministers is made by the Governor. He also appoints the members of the State Public Service Commission, Advocate General and other important officials of the State.\n",
      "(b) Division of work of Ministers: In consultation with the Chief Minister, the Governor distributes the portfolios or the departments of the Ministers.\n",
      "(c) Control over the Executive: Since the Governor is the head of the State Executive, he exercises his control over it. He exercises hiscontrol over the subjects that come under the State List.\n",
      "(d) Control over subjects of Concurrent List: The Governor also exercises control over the subjects of the Concurrent list.\n",
      "(e) Discretionary Powers: The Constitution has also provided certain discretionary powers to the Governor. If the Governor finds that administration of the State cannot be carried on according to the provisions of the Constitution, he may report it to the President. If the President is satisfied and agrees withthe report of the Governor and makes a proclamation of emergency on that ground, the Governor may be asked to act as an agent of the Central Government for the administration of the State.\n",
      "2. Legislative Powers: The legislative powers of the Governor may be studied under the following heads:\n",
      "Power to summon, address and dissolve the Legislative Assembly: According to Article 174, the Governor may summon and prorogue the House and can also dissolve the Legislative Assembly at any time. He addresses the first session of the State-Legislature after the general elections and first session of every year begins with the Governor’s address, if required, he can summon the joint sitting of the two Houses of the State Legislature and may address it. He may send his messages to either of the two Houses.\n",
      "Power to nominate some members of the Legislatures: The Governor nominates one-sixth members of the Legislative Council of the State.\n",
      "Power to Pass the Bills: Except Money Bills, it depends upon the will of the Governor whether to give or refuse to give his consent on the Bill. He may send any Bill to the President for his consideration He can return any Bill to the Legislative Assembly to consider the recommendations that he makes on it, but if the Legislative Assembly again passes the same Bill by the majority of its members, the Governor cannot refuse to sign the Bill. No Bill can become an Act unless and until it receives the assent of the Governor.\n",
      "Powers to issue Ordinances: According to Article 231, the Governor is entitled to promulgate Ordinance when the Legislature is not in session and the need of it arises. Such ordinances have the force of law till six weeks after the re-assembly of the Legislature unless, of course, cancelled or withdrawn sooner.\n",
      "3. Financial Powers: The Governor exercises the following financial \n",
      " powers as will:\n",
      "Presentation of the Annual Budget: In the beginning of each financial year, the Governor gets the annual budget presented in the Legislative Assembly, through the Finance Minister of State.\n",
      "Powers regarding Money Bills: Article 207 provides that no money Bill can be introduced in the Legislative Assembly of the State except on the Governor's permission.\n",
      "Powers regarding Contingency Fund: According to Article 267(2), the Contingency Fund of the State remains at the disposal of the Governor, who can make advances out of it to meet unforeseen expenditure pending its authorisation by the State Legislature.\n",
      "Judicial Powers: Article 161 of the Constitution provides that the Governor shall have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remission of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of an offence against any law relating to a matter, to which the executive power of the State extends. But if the punishment has been given under the laws and rules made by the Union Government, then the Governor can only make his recommendations to the President. \n",
      "Real Position of the Governor: In principle, Governor is the real head of the State, but in practice he acts on the advice of .his Cabinet. Broadly speaking, his actual position is analogous to that of the President. His is an office of honour, rather than that of powers. Most of the power legally given to him, are really exercised by his Ministers, on whose advice he has to act. But this does not mean that the post of Governor is useless and powerless. As a matter of fact, if the Governor performs his functions properly and efficiently he can render a great service to the State. If he is a person of impressive personality, he can certainly influence the administration. Regarding the position of Governor, Mr M. V Pylee, an eminent scholar writes, “A sagacious councillor and adviser to the Ministry one who can throw oil on the troubled waters of the State politics.”\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "It is true that the Governor has to act in accordance with the will of the Cabinet, but he has his direction in the appointment of Chief Minister, when there is no clear majority of any party in the State Legislative Assembly. During the time of President's rule in the State, he becomes the real head of the Executive and in this situation he acts as an agent of the President. Thus, Governor is neither a figure-head nor a rubber-stamp, but a functionary designed to play a vital role in the administration of the affairs of the State.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Indian Constitution has provided for the setting up of Legislature in each State. The Constitution provides for the setting up of two Houses of Legislature in some States, whereas in other States there is the provision of setting up of only one House of State Legislature. In the States of Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Jammu & Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, there are two houses while in other States, there is one House. The Upper House and the Lower House of the States having bicameral legislature, are called Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly respectively.\n",
      "Composition of Legislative Assembly\n",
      "Legislative Assemblies of the States are constituted mostly by the members directly elected through adult franchise. Every person who has completed the age of 18 years may be enroled as a voter and vote for electing the members of General Assembly. There are different numbers of seats for different Legislative Assemblies of the States. Ordinarily, each member of the Legislative Assembly represents a population of 75,000 persons but in some states a member of Legislative Assembly represents even the lesser population. Some seats are reserved for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on population basis. Article 333 provides that the Governor of any State may nominate to its Assembly such number of representatives of the Anglo-Indian community as he deems fit, provided that he is of the opinion that the Anglo-Indian community is not adequately represented in the Assembly.\n",
      "Qualification of the Members\n",

The State Legislature has also been provided with some powers to legislate on the subjects of the Concurrent List. But the law made by the State Legislature should not be repugnant to the law made by the Parliament on the same subject of the Concurrent List.\n",
      "(2) Financial Functions: In the beginning of each financial year, the Governor gets presented in the Legislative Assembly a statement of annual income and expenditure called Budget. No money Bill can be initiated in the Legislative Council. After a Bill is passed by the Legislative Assembly, it is sent to the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council either passes the Bill in its original form within 14 days or sends it back to the Legislative Assembly after making its recommendation. The Legislative Assembly is not bound to accept the recommendations of the Council. If the Council does not pass the Money Bill or the budget within 14 days, the Bill is deemed to have been passed by the Council. Thus, the Legislative Assembly exercises full control over the income and expenditure of the State. No new tax can be imposed or existing tax abolished without its consent or approval. Except a few items, the State Legislature cannot reduce the amount of expenditure on - (i) salary and allowances etc., of the Governor; (ii) salary and allowances of the Judges of High Court; (iii) salary and other expenditure relating to the offices of the Speaker, Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council (iv) Government debt and interest on it; and (v) payment of decree passed by a court.\n",

      "(4) Control over the Executive: The State Legislature exercises control over the Executive of the State. The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly, and, therefore, the Cabinet is bound to work in accordance with the wishes of the Assembly. The State Cabinet has to resign if it loses the confidence of the Legislative Assembly.

      "To know about the composition and functions of state council of ministers\n",
      "Structure \n",
      "Composition – Position of the Chief Minister – Functions of the cabinet – Conclusion.\n",
      "Composition of the State Cabinet\n",
      "Article 163(1) provides that there shall be a Council of Ministers with Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of the functions, except in so far as he is by or under this constitution required to exercise his function or any or term in his discretion. After the general elections, the Governor usually invites the leader of the majority party in the Legislative Assembly to form the Ministry. The other ministers of the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. In practice, the Chief Minister sends the list of Ministers along with the departments to be alloted to them, to the Governor and latter accepts the list and appoints Ministers accordingly It is not necessary that a person appointed as the Minister must be member of either of the two Houses of State Legislature at that time. However, it is necessary that he must become member of either of the two Houses of the State Legislature within six months from the date of his appointment as Minister. The number of Ministers is also not fixed. It may be increased or decreased in accordance with the need of time. There are three kinds of Ministers in the Council of Ministers - (1) Cabinet Ministers, (2) State Ministers and (3) Deputy Ministers. Only the Ministers holding the important departments are included in the State Cabinet. After being appointed, each Minister has to take an oath of his office before the Governor. The term of the Ministers has not been fixed. Generally, their term is 5 years, which is the term of the Legislative Assembly. The Chief Minister can ask any Minister to resign from the Ministry. If he refuses to do so, the Chief Minister can reshuffle his Cabinet by dropping him. The Minister can also, resign before the expiry of their term. If the Legislative Assembly passes a resolution of no-confidence against the Cabinet, the Cabinet has to tender its resignation.\n",
      "Position of the Chief Minister\n",
      "The Chief Minister is the Chairman of the Council of Ministers! He occupies almost the same position which is occupied by the Prime Minister in the Union Cabinet. The Chief Minister is the important link between the State Cabinet and the Governor. In practice, he exercise the different powers conferred upon the Governor by the Constitution of India The Chief Minister appoints different Ministers, distributes different departments among them, keeps supervision over the departments and works, of other Ministers, and presides over the meetings of the Cabinet. He informs the Governor about the policy and administrative matter of the administration. In practice, no Minister can hold his office even a moment longer than in desired by the Chief Minister If the Chief Minister resigns, the whole Cabinet has to resign in consequence of his resignation.\n",
      "Because of his being the leader of the majority party in the Legislative Assembly, the Chief Minister is also the leader of the Legislative Assembly. He can advise the Governor to dissolve the Legislative Assembly. In fact, under his powers he can get any Bill passed, can get amount sanctioned for Government expenditure and can get any tax imposed. Whatever he says and assurance he gives on behalf of the Government, are considered authentic. Constitutionally, the Governor has a right to appoint the Advocate General, Chairman and the members of the State Public Service Commission, but in practice this power is exercised by the Chief Minister. He advises the Governor to appoint particular persons on the said posts.\n",
      "Functions of the Cabinet\n",
      "The carrying on of the administration of the State is the grave responsibility of the Cabinet. Here we are giving a brief account of the functions of State Cabinet.\n",
      "(1) Administrative Functions: The different members of Cabinet look after the works of different departments and the collective responsibility of all the departments rests upon the Cabinet. In practice, the Cabinet is responsible to the Legislative Assembly and any of its members can ask any questions from the Minister concerned. The Minister look after the administrative works of their respective departments.\n",
      "Determining and laying down the policies of State Government: The State Cabinet determines, and lays down the policies of the State and makes plans for their proper implementation.\n",
      "Legislative Function: It is an important function of the Cabinet to present the necessary Bills in the Legislative Assembly and to get them passed.\n",
      "Preparation and the passing of Annual Budget: Every year in the beginning of the financial year, the Cabinet gets prepared the budget and presents it before the Legislative Assembly. After undergoing the procedure, the budget is ultimately passed by the State Legislature.\n",
      "Propagation of State policies in Public: The different members of the Cabinet propagate the policies of the State among the people so as to bring about awakening among them and to seek their help and Cooperation in the performance of Government works and the implementation of the policies of state.\n",
      "Relationship between the Cabinet and the Legislative Assembly\n",
      "The Cabinet of the State is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly. It has to keep the Legislative Assembly informed of each of its works. A Cabinet may continue to function so long as it commands confidence and majority in the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly can compel the Cabinet at any time to resign by passing resolution of no-confidence against it. The Cabinet has also to resign if any important Bill presented by it in the Legislative Assembly is not passed. If a resolution of no-confidence is passed against any Minister, the whole Cabinet has to resign. Thus, the Cabinet is helpless before the Legislative Assembly.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "It is true that the Cabinet cannot do anything against the will of the Legislative Assembly, yet it is mostly seen that in consequence of the majority of their party, the Cabinet Ministers do whatever they like in the Legislative Assembly. Moreover, the Chief Minister's power to advise the Governor to dissolve the Legislative Assembly is so important that he commands a respect and terror from all the members of the Legislative Assembly. Thus, in practice, instead of being controlled by the Legislative Assembly, it is the Cabinet that exercises a control over the Legislative Assembly.\n",

A judge of the High Court can also be removed from his office. However, the procedure for this is quite difficult and special one. The Constitution provides that the judge of a High Court cannot be removed except on an address presented to the President by the Parliament with a two third majority only on two grounds: (i) proved capacity, and (ii) proved misconduct. The removal of the judge of a High Court takes effect only after the President gives his consent to such a resolution of the Parliament. After consultation with the Chief justice of India, the President may transfer a judge from one High Court to any other High Court. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may request the President to re-appoint a retired judge and if the President re-appoints him as a judge, he gets the same salary and allowances as are given to the other judges.\n",
